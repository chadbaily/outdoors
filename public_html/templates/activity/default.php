<h1>Activities</h1>

<p>This part of the website manages activities.  Members can indicate that they
are interested in an activity (via their "Interests"), and adventures can
indicate that they "are that type" of adventure.  Locations can also indicate
that they are associated with that type of activity.  Any activity is just a
description of something one might do, such as hiking or fishing.</p>
