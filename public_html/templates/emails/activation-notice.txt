Our email list is run on an opt-out basis.  Right now, you're set to receive all emails so you won't miss out on anything.  You can choose not to receive certain types of email by logging in to the website and finding the "Profile" link under "Member's Area" on the member home page.  You should become familiar with this page, as it is your central resource in the club. In addition to the adventures posted online, note the "Member Resources" tab; this has a wealth of information, but of particular interest are our policies on borrowing gear, leading trips, and reimbursements.
