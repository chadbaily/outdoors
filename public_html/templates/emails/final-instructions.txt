Dear {C_FULL_NAME},

Thank you for joining {CLUB_NAME}!  You have chosen the {MEMBERSHIP} membership plan.

As soon as we process everything and activate your membership, we'll send you an email welcoming you to the club.

Due to the limited number of officers in town during school breaks, we do not check our mailbox as regularly as during the school year.  If you submit your 
waiver during summer or winter break, please email the officers at outdoors-officers@virginia.edu so that we know to check for your waiver and dues.  Thanks!
