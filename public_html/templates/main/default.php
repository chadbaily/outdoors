waterfall">Outdoors at UVa is an exciting and fun outdoors club based
at the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, VA.
We are a 100% student-run organization, so most of our
members are <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>
students, but we have many community members and Alum who are active as well.</p>
