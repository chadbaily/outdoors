Box 400444,Charlottesville, VA 22904 or drop it by the post office in Newcomb Hall, box 400444.
Please be sure to include your membership dues. as shown below (check made out to Outdoors at UVa). Cash is highly discouraged (Outdoors at UVa is not responsible if it gets lost) and if you must turn in your dues in cash email the officers and we will give you our gear room times where you can meet us to physically turn in your dues. Finally, you may pay online via  <c:alink:https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1535/customform/index.aspx?sid=1535&gid=16&pgid=1199&cid=2383&dids=880&BLEDIT=1>UVaFund</c:alink>. If you choose this route, you MUST either email the officers a receipt of the payment, or (preferably) print and send in a copy of payment along with your waiver.

<b>NOTE</b> We encourage you to use regular postal mail, not messenger mail.  Messenger mail sometimes takes weeks to get to us.

The <b>fastest and easiest</b> way to get your dues and waiver to us is to take it to the Newcomb Hall post office and hand it across the desk (no postage needed; they will place it directly into our mailbox). <b> When you hand in a waiver and (proof of) payment at the same time, activation will be much quicker!</b>
If absolutely necessary, you may also deliver your dues and waiver to an officer in person (only if necessary; we are very busy).  Contact the officers at outdoors-officers@virginia.edu if you must meet an officer. 

Once we have received your dues, we will activate your membership and send you an email welcoming you to the club.
