This directory contains code for things that all objects can use.  Generally
speaking, all you have to do is include the appropriate file from this
directory, and let it do the work.  However, you DO have to do this much: create
an object of the appropriate type and name it $object.  If you don't it'll
break.  These pages also expect there to be a Member object called $user, who is
the current user of the website.
