The outdoors has always been a focal point of my life. Growing up in Southern Virginia I was always surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. Thus, it became essential that on any given weekend I would be out hiking, camping, or out constructing a rope swing by the 'ol watering hole or even a nice duck tape raft. Eventually the adventuring developed into exploring frozen waterfalls, odd places like 'foamhenge', trail running, and climbing buildings (unfortunately some people aren't okay with this). So, upon joining the outdoors club at UVa I had clearly found my fix. The club introduced me to rock climbing, and let's just say I quickly developed a lust for the sport. Nowadays I can be found out bouldering at a new crag, at the gym, or around grounds (so be sure to come say 'hey!' if you see me). Has it become an obsession? Maybe. Anyhoo, I must say I love the Outdoors club and all the opportunities it holds (hopefully soon I'll get into kayaking). So if you ever want to go for climb, slack some line, or anything, there are good chances I won't say no. Cheers.

I grew up mainly in Virginia and spent a lot of my suburban childhood fishing in abandoned golf course ponds and wandering around the woods looking for animals.  My family always hiked together when we would vacation in the Adirondacks, and we skied together pretty much every winter.  Once I got to UVA I picked up backpacking through the club, then slacklining, then climbing, and I'm hoping I'll be mountain biking more coming soon.  I'm totally stoked to shared what I've learned with as many people as possible and look forward to seeing you on the trail, at the crag, or on the line.

I have always loved the outdoors from early in my childhood. I was that hippy kid running around with long hair and no shoes looking at bugs, tree, stars or something.  Then my years spent as a camper and staff at a summer camp in the Blue Ridge hooked me forever.  I was lucky enough to grow up right at the foot of the Blue Ridge and junction of the Skyline and Parkway where I spent many days on my road bike.  Recently through my time with the Outdoors Club I have become an avid backpacker, day hiker, and Teddy Graham connoisseur.  I would love to add rock climbing, bouldering, and kayaking to my list of amazing stuff to do.  I also need to get my lazy self back out on my mountain bike so bug me to do some Walnut Creek trips.  Before all that happens though I will be setting up my slackline as often as I can escape the clutches of Clemons.  There is no doubt I will be leading some sweet(at least I think so) backpacking and day hiking trips so get excited and I will see you out there.

Sitting up in a tree with a good book was one of my favorite things to do growing up.  I loved exploring the woods behind my house with my brothers.  They were endless!  We would leave for hours at a time and not realize how long we had been gone.  Joining Outdoors at UVa was a great idea for me then, to realize how much more there was to do outdoors and to learn new trails!  I've gotten into a bit of rock climbing, but the woods are still my first love and I hope I can help you find your true outdoors love, too!  See you on the trails!

Growing up in Central Florida, I loved hiking and kayaking, but I had never experienced the mountains until a backpacking trip to Shenandoah in the 7th grade.  That trip left an insatiable appetite for the mountains. Since joining the Outdoors Club, I have picked up climbing and skiing and I now spend my summers working as a rock climbing instructor in the Rocky Mountains. So whether its hiking, rock climbing, kayaking, backpacking, skiing, or pretty much anything else, come join me in the mountains!

Regardless of weather, season, and location, I ache to be outside.  For me, few things compare to the quiet elegance of a forest or the breathtaking views as an expansive landscape unfolds below.  As a native Connecticuter, I developed a fondness for hiking, swimming, and camping at an early age and realized my passion for mountain biking midway through high school.  I love the thrill of snaking between trees and racing down hillsides, not to mention the great friends I've made along the way.  In addition to biking, I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, kayaking, stargazing, and simply adventuring wherever the trails lead.  I'm so excited that the club offers so many wonderful opportunities for outdoors enthusiasts and I hope you'll join me on a ride.  Let's hit the trails!

My love for the outdoors started well before my memories. Growing in the Vermont countryside, I spent far more time outdoors than watching television. I was sleeping in a tent before walking or talking, hiking before kindergarten, and backpacking in elementary school. By high school graduation I had dabbled in rock climbing. After a brief hiatus in undergrad, I have returned to all of these sports in force. Currently I am most active in rock climbing and backpacking, both attending and leading trips regularly. Other activities are berrypicking, swimming in streams, day hikes, camping, stargazing, snowshoeing, and most other outdoor activities. The mountains are one of the most relaxing and rewarding places to spend a weekend whether on rock, a mountaintop, a long hike, or a short wander. Come and relax in the woods!</tr>

I grew up in southern California, but still developed a love for the outdoors.  As a kid my summer vacations consisted of driving up to a national park and camping for a week.  Having visited places like Yosemite, Yellowstone, and the Grand Canyon quite easy to want to spend some time with something other than walls surrounding me.  I would also climb any tree with branches, which I think developed into my interest in rock climbing.  Since I started rock climbing in early 2009 I've become addicted to it.  I look forward to Peak days and I'm always itching to get back out to the New River.  I'm also hoping to soon get some experience whitewater kayaking.  The Outdoors Club has let me pursue my outdoorsy desires to my heart's content.

Loving the outdoors is easy. I come from the northern Shenandoah Valley, living 5 miles from the Appalachian Trail.  Historically, summer has been my season of outdoors romping and is when you can find me at a summer camp up in northern Michigan. Over 12 summers, I have explored many a part of Michigan, Canada and Alaska by way of backpacking, canoeing, portaging or kayaking.  Now in the Outdoors Club, I have extended my adventures into all times of the year and have fallen in love with rock climbing, bouldering and the like!

The great outdoors became a passion of mine somewhere in my adolescence. Sports had always motivated me to get outside and be active, and the two that I had pursued the most were skiing and fly fishing, both when I had lived in West Virginia and in Colorado. In Colorado, my outdoors interests only grew. Initially, I only wanted to hike if fishing or skiing was involved, but I found the appeal in simply hiking and backpacking as well. (But if there's a remote chance for fishing on a hike I'll still bring a rod with me just in case). Fishing has also gotten me into mountain biking, Having joined the Outdoors club, I've started climbing (mostly bouldering), if only a little, and would like to expand my activities further.

    I am compulsively, magnetically attracted to rock.  I love rock and it loves
    me.  When I was little I would beg my dad to take me bouldering, I would
    dream up places we'd never been.  And, now thanks to our fabulous Outdoors
    Club I can climb any time I want.  Currently I've been doing a lot of sport
    climbing, but hopefully soon I'll be getting into trad!  When I can&rsquo;t
    climb I might decide to camp in the woods, take a hike, clean up a highway,
    or just watch the stars.  And lastly, my love of rock is balanced by a crazy
    fear of the water.

   Hi!  I've been involved with the club since its revival a few years ago.  I'm
   now graduated, but I live in Charlottesville and have had such good times and
   met so many awesome people through the club that I stick around and plan to
   keep on doing it.  I work on the website a good bit, because I'm a programmer
   and it's so much fun to work on something that I'm not getting told to do!  I
   love hiking and running, camping and hiking, skiing and hiking, and just
   about everything else we do and hiking.  I also love just going out and looking at the
   stars or something.  I've been known to be hard-core but I don't need to in
   order to be happy.

Nothing makes me happier than being outdoors, having an adventure while singing a song that gets lost in the open air.  I've grown up hiking and camping with my family, and fell in love with canoeing after transporting kids around a lake as a camp-counselor.  While I am still working on perfecting the Eskimo roll in a kayak, I will gladly duel anyone to a canoe race.  At UVA I've fallen in love with the pain that goes along with back-packing and the leisure that accompanies playing on a beach.  My love of the woods is only equaled by my love of the water; I will be the first one to jump into a random watering-hole on a hike and anytime mud is nearby, you will find me covered from head to toe.

Wherever I am and whatever I'm doing, I would prefer that it be outdoors. Since I could walk I've loved to hike, and more recently I've found a love for rock climbing. I love being outdoors year-round, but my summers as a camp counselor have instilled in me a deep love for for shooting stars, finding shark's teeth on the banks of the James River with my campers, and just in general spreading my love of the outdoors with the kids. Around here at UVA you will see me slacklining, climbing, stargazing, hiking, and always chilling outside. I'm always up for the next big adventure, whether it is a well-worn hike or a new bouldering location. Everything's better outdoors-- see you there!
