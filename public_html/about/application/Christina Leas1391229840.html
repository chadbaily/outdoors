    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Outdoors club has meant a lot to me during my time at UVa and I would like to get more involved in its development. I believe it could improve by being more accessible to "novice" outdoorsmen/women by offering more beginner trips and low key outdoors activities (such as... star gazing, shorter hikes, rafting). It would also be great to develop a stronger connection with the Outdoor Recreation Center. Their resource library, especially, is a very helpful but under appreciated service that I think Outdoors Club members could take advantage of. I would offer to the club this link between the two organizations. </td>
