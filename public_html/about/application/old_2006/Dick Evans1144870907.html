    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>Rapids, waves, whitewater, currents - these things scare me.  Climbing is better than paddling anyway.  I would use this space to explain why philosophers over the ages have proved that climbing was better than paddling, but it would take too much space, and everyone reading this is probably a tasteless rube with the mental capacity of a 4th grader anyway.</td>

    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>For the past several years I have had a difficult time keeping myself out of the local backcountry.  Some people derive contentment from the Bible and entrust their faith in God. I have a backpack and boots- and seek contentment from the mountains I climb- thanks to their brilliant and shimmering beauty.  Yes, I know that shimmering is a gay word.  However, I am gay.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I feel like I can use it to make me look cool and important so that I can hit on Latino, Persian, and Arabian girls who are in the club.  I also think I may be able to help people in the club who may be feeling "disenfranchised."
