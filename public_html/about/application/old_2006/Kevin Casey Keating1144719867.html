    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I love the outdoors and would love to be more involved in this program.  I think the outdoors club provides a great opportunity for a lot of people to do stuff they either wouldn't or couldn't do on their own, and for people with common interests to meet.  

I wasn't very active this year in the club, but I plan on participating a lot more next semester and throughout undergrad.  I don't expect to become an officer next semester, but as the e-mail said, maybe you'll keep me in mind for the future.  </td>
