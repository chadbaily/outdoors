    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I accredit my love for the outdoors to my parents who took me on rain walks when all the other children were stuck inside during thunderstorms, and my seventh grade science teacher who owned an eight foot python and took our class spelunking as a field trip. Since then I’ve never passed up an opportunity to try a new outdoor activity. I get cabin fever fairly easily, so when I came to UVA last year I was looking for an organization like the Outdoor Club. I’m so glad I got involved in this club my first semester because of the people I met, the experiences I had, and the break it gave me from the typical first year routine. I've really enjoyed this club and want to be an officer to make sure others can have the same great experiences I've had.</td>
