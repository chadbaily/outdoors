    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I ran four seasons in high school.  Although that might not seem very outdoorsy, I ran outdoors in all conditions: run, sleet, snow, the freezing cold and wind. Those four years toughened me up and I realized that I loved being outdoors doing physical activities.  </td>

    <td>I love this club and therefore I would love to be more involved.  Since I have some financial experience from working at Legg Mason this summer and house council this year, I believe I am best suited for those positions.  Afterwards, I wish to be even more involved later during college when I have access to a car.  I understand that I might not have as much experience as the rest of the officers; however, I am pretty athletic and would really love to help out this club.</td>
