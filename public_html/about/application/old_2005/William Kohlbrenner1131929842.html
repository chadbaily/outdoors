    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I really have enjoyed the Outdoors club so far. Its provided a lot of opportunities for me (for cheap too!). I really want to give back to the club in any way I can. Also, Im sure this will make it a little easier for me to lead trips. Even though I have been checked out to lead climbing trips, I want to have a little fun right now and practice more (I would like to be climbing 5.10-5.11 by Second Semester, and be somewhat schooled in using artificial anchors), so I probably will not lead till second semester. Still, I think I could add a lot to the club during the break, whether it be in researching gear for people to buy, going over expenses, etc. I would really appreciate the opportunity to be an officer here. </td>
