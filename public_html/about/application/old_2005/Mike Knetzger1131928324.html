    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I enjoy what the outdoors clubs offers, and have enjoyed participating in many trips through the club.  I've led four trips over this year and last year, and have liked doing that as well.  When I don't get outside or into the woods for too long a period of time, I start to get stressed out, so I also think that being an officer would encourage me to lead more trips and keep me in step.  </td>
