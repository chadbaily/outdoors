    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to feel comfortable leading more trips, and I think being an officer would help with this.  I love what the club does and the people in it.  However, I feel like it's a very loose organization right now and most people only know the other people they've been on trips with, so I'd like to come up with new ideas to bring people of different sports together.  Yet what it really all boils down to is my passion for the outdoors and my friendships with other enthusiasts.  </td>
