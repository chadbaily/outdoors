    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I was involved with "Indian Princesses" until the age of 14-15. This program was sponsored by the YMCA and my "tribe" would go hiking, canoeing, and camping frequently. Additionally, I used to be a girl scout.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I have paddled the New/Gauley River's lower class section and rafted the higher class section. I live in Richmond and have frequently paddled the the Upper section of the James in addition to occasionally paddling the lower section. This past summer I paddled the lower section of the Youghiogheny, (water levels were pretty low and made it more manageable). Overall, I'd say I feel comfortable on the class 1-4 level, but I would want to have experienced paddlers with me on a class 4 river. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I spent two weeks at an adventure camp in high school. We slept in tents the whole time while hiking, horseback riding, and traveling down the New river. I learned a lot about how to manage waste and how to "leave no trace" when living in nature from this camp. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>My major at UVA is kinesiology and I am always interested in fitness and exercise. For example, a course I am currently in focuses on the physics of how to train individuals to correct their movements and motor behaviors in order to enhance their performance. I will love to put my new skills to the test in seeing if I can teach a fellow club member how to properly hold his or her paddle in the water, or how to more efficiently stroke the paddle for maximum power. 
Becoming an officer in the outdoors club will mean more involvement, which I would love because I am very passionate about the outdoors. No matter how terrible my week of school has been, being in the outdoors always makes me happy. Thanks to my dad, I have grown up experiencing the outdoors, and I feel that I have a vast knowledge of a wide variety of outdoors skills that can help others for their trips. 
One step to improve the club would be to hold those who sign up for a trip more accountable for their attendance. I am aware that their is a way to mark them absent from the trip, but this seems to rarely actually happen. Out of the trips I've led, I've been the only driver and had one or two people not show up(making it a much smaller trip than I had hoped) or I have had one of my drivers cancel on me last minute.
