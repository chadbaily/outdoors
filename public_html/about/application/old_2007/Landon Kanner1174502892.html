    <td>Mountain biked a ton in High School, and some 1st and 2nd year, but totaled my bike 2nd year and haven't ridden much since.  I grew up biking in Kanawha State Forest.  In high school I did a weekend trip biking at Snowshoe and biked the Kaymoor-Cunard trail in the New River Gorge.  In Charlottesville I've biked all over O hill and done most of the Rivanna Trail.  I've biked at Walnut Creek a number of times.  I've also done a lot of biking in Shenandoah NP (but don't tell anyone).  I rented a mt. bike one day in Australia in a town called Port Douglas and tore up some trails there and on my Israel trip we biked in the Golan Heights.  I've also done some biking w/ brother in the Baltimore/DC area.</td>
