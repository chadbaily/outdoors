    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I am an Eagle Scout.  I was president of the Outdoors Club at my high school.  I am the treasurer of the UVA Mountain Biking Club.  I compete on the VASST Men's Ski Team in slalom.  I did Philmont (11 day backpacking trip in New Mexico) while I was in Scouts.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Climbing experience</td>
    <td>I can top rope, I worked on a climbing tower at a Boy Scout summer camp and was certified by the BSA to lead top rope and rapelling trips.  I can belay lead climbers in either sport or trad at any level on a single pitch.  I used to be able to climb trad and sport at 5.9, but I haven't tried in almost two years.  I was able to lead climb 5.7 for sport.</td>

    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I am comfortable on class II and the occasional short class III if it's flat afterwards.  I have never been comfortable with my roll.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Mountain biking experience</td>
    <td>I have done a significant amount of biking, and I am comfortable leading trips of first-timers through intermediate.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>I did Philmont while in Scouts, we did an 11 day trip covering 70 miles.  I have done lots of weekend backpacking trips through Scouts and my high school outdoors club.  I also attended the trip to Mt. Rogers my first year over fall break.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Caving experience</td>
    <td>I have been several times on both guided and unguided trips through Scouts and my high school outdoors club.  However, all of the trips were in Kentucky, so I am not comfortable leading trips here without knowing the caves better.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I race on the ski team here at UVA.  I am comfortable with technical descents ranging from cliffs, glades, moguls, and cornices and have considerable experience at Wintergreen, Snowshoe, Killington, and several resorts in Colorado.  I would be comfortable leading trips to any of these places for any level of experience.  I also feel comfortable teaching through the intermediate level.  I do not snowboard, but want to learn.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I help out with trail maintenance through the UVA MBC at Walnut Creek and O'Hill.  I did quite a bit of trail maintenance in high school as well.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer because I want to become more involved.  I know this is a student run organization and if no one takes initiative and roles of responsibility nothing will happen.  I feel as though I have a lot to offer the club.  I know quite a bit about the appropriations committee and the filing required to receive funds from them.  I also know alot about most of the activities we do, and I want to make sure it is passed along.  I was just recently activated as a trip leader and unfortunately I had to cancel my first trip (biking at Walnut Creek) because an injury.  I will be leading more trips this semester, so please don't hold the fact that I haven't done so yet against me.  I know I have to lead at least 3 trips to be eligible to be an officer.</td>
