    <td>I've been mountain biking at walnut creek a few times.  This summer in August I'm going to do a Xterra (triathlon: swim, mountain bike, and then train run) at Walnut creek so I'm going to buy a mountain bike and get a lot more into it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>I've backpacked in West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and in the Adirondacks in New York.  I've done hiking all over Virginia, a decent bit in the Adirondacks, and this last summer I went with my family and hiked a lot in Colorado.  I feel very comfortable backpacking and although I have never led any club trips I have organized two Virginia backpacking trips with my friends outside of the club to St. Mary's and Apple Orchard Falls. </td>

    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I ski every winter with my family and hope to actually buy a snowshoe season pass my 4th year.  I have only skied in Virgina and West Virginia and I do the hardest slopes available (I don't know if this means I'm actually a talented skier though)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I run UVA club cross country and I am very familiar with Charlottesville's trails.  I have never done any trail running with the outdoor's club since I train every week in the fall with my team. Once it warms up I might try and led a trip to Dick Wood's road to run because it is honestly the best run of all time.  I was also a member of Green Team in high school.  We did all the school's plastic and metal recycling.  I'm also pretty good at catching large mouth bass.  I love fishing and whenever I go to New York with my family I pretty much fish every day.  I've tried to teach myself how to fly fish and have unsuccessfully tried to actually fly fish in West Virginia and Colorado.  I love slacklining!!!!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>In high school I loved the outdoors but when I got to college I didn't really do much of my usual outdoor activities my first year.  After going backpacking with my high school friends the next summer I had probably one of the best times of my life.  I also realize I had no idea what I was doing since we used our school book bags and brought canned food.  My first real backpacking trip with proper gear and food was with the club spring break my second year.  My first time I actually rock climbed, mountain biked, and slacklined was with the club the summer after my second year.  I have learned so much and made so many good friends.  I think its my responsibility to pass on some of the knowledge I've picked up to those who are new to the club.  I love teaching people!!!  I think I'll bring a lot of enthusiasm to the club and a lot of passion for my activities.  On a different note, I have coded two websites in my classes and I have worked in software development the past two summers.  I think I could definitely help out with the website a lot.  I noticed when I had gear over a week I got an email from Andrew that I needed to return it.  I think the problem with overdue gear not being returned could possibly be fixed by updating the website.  The server that the website resides on could have a chronological job coded into to look through the gear database for overdue gear and automatically email members of what they have overdue.</td>
