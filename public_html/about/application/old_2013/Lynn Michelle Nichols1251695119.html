    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>In addition to all the incredible activities the Outdoors Club offers, I also appreciate the club's awesome commitment to providing the chance for both students and the Charlottesville community to appreciate the outdoors.  I have always admired the ability to bring together people of all skill levels and backgrounds in such an inclusive and welcoming environment, and hardly a trip passes in which I have not learned a new skill or made a new friend.  This club has heightened my love of the outdoors, and I would like to give back to such a remarkable organization.  
One way I hope to give back is by generating more interest in mountain biking and creating as many opportunities for people to get into the sport as possible.  I would love the opportunity to help people improve their skills so that the club can take advantage of some of the great mountain biking that Virginia offers.
I also understand that being an officer in the club entails more responsibility than just leading trips, and I am eager to serve the club in any way I can.  I am very responsible and have been deeply involved in leadership roles with the other organizations in which I have taken part at UVA.  I am very passionate about the club and committed to giving its members the opportunity to love the wonderful activities the outdoors have to offer.   </td>
