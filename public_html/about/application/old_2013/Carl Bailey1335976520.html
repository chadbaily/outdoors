    <td>I want to help the Outdoors Club be successful. I've gotten a lot out of it so far, so I would like to contribute to the cause. The biggest thing I can add is more opportunities for people to get into mountain biking, as I have shown through the trips I've led this semester. I'd be willing to spend time on all of the normal officer duties. Additionally, I'd like to try fixing some of the problems with the website such as the trip pictures portal and try to bring the site a little more up to date.</td>
