    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>From my sophomore year until senior year I was involved with the Wintergreen Adaptive Ski Program (WAS).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>At WAS, I was an instructor, leading lessons for mentally and/or physically handicapped students of all different backgrounds, conditions, and ages. As an instructor, I was responsible for being aware of the student's condition, and fashioning an appropriate lesson which the student would enjoy, be challenged, and grow in their snow skills. Some students I would work with throughout the season while others were new week to week.
Currently I am a member of a Jefferson Public Citizens (JPC) team. Our group, ecoMOD5: Falmouth, Jamaica, is organizing the building of a 'wet module' and rehabilitation of an historic home in Falmouth, Jamaica. My role is to coordinate and document the historic preservation of the original home. </td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Although I do not have an extensive expertise in outdoors activities, I have a great affinity for the outdoors and go on trips whenever I can. I have an extensive background in organizing and coordinating events from high school and wedding planning which heavily rely on the cooperation and involvement of people. I find I enjoy these situations most and believe that with my passion for the outdoors and able to plan and organize, I am a strong candidate. Being from Charlottesville, I am very aware of the local outdoors community as well as in contact with local outdoors leaders. I believe what Charlottesville has to offer would only enhance the opportunity for student trips and connections. I believe making these connections and my organization skills would allow for the club to plan larger trips that may seem out of reach. But, most importantly, I love being outdoors in whatever capacity that may take. And because of that I would love to be more involved in a club that gets people out and on adventures, enjoying and exploring the great outdoors.</td>
