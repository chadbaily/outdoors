  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I have been fly-fishing since I was four. I plan on leading several many trips in the future, and many of my trips likely will involve water or opportunities for fly fishing. 

I also like to hunt and shoot skeet quite a bit, but I know this has never really been part of the club in the past. I would love to see introductory shooting adventures incorporated into the clubs activities but understand the liability may not allow it. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Perhaps, my biggest regret from college has been that I just now discovered how active the club is this year. I have a great deal of experience backpacking and backcountry camping. I plan on leading many trips in the future, and understand that my application may be put on hold until I have a chance to prove my experience to the club. Although I do not have my wilderness certification or CPR current, I have been certified in the past and  did pass emergency preparedness badges in boy scouts, and do remember passing a wilderness survival level in scouts but do not know if it was a badge. I can add a great deal of experience in leading backcountry adventures and fly-fishing. I grew up in Bristol,TN and moved in high school to Charlottesville. I know Mt Rogers area and damascus very well and have backpacked Mt. Rogers at least 6 times, and know fishing in that area and anywhere within two hours here like the back of my hand. I would feel more than comfortable leading any trips of that nature, and any snow sports related activities. 

To improve the club, I would like to add the possibility of shooting activities, but like I said realize that constraints that might exist and prevent this. I have seen Lila's casting workshops and think it is a great idea, and would like to see more trips led into the national forest and other areas fishing and exploring new creeks to fish. 

As I have said, I regret that I have just now discovered the club, and how active it is. I have been on several many trips since then, and am leading the trip to the everglades for spring break as I am sure you are well aware of. I understand that I have not had a chance to prove myself to the club capable as an officer, but have no doubt my experience in the outdoors will be beneficial to the club in the near future. I hope that if my application falls short at this time due to the fact that I haven't had the chance to lead many trips yet that it will hopefully be reviewed again at the end of the semester after I have had a chance to lead several more. </td>
