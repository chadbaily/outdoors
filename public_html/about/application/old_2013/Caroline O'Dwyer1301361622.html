    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I have been a Squad Leader in Navy ROTC for the past two semesters. I am in command of 4 other members of Navy ROTC, all of them different years. I am responsible for making sure that they are progressing as Midshipmen in the program and meeting or exceeding all standards. As a Squad Leader, I am expected to set the example for the rest of the Squad in all Navy ROTC related areas. Being a Squad Leader requires excellent time management and organizational skills, as well as good interpersonal skills. 

I have also been Vice President of the Class of 2013 Nursing Student Council for two years. I help coordinate, motivate, and organize class activities and fundraisers.</td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer because I really love the club and want to be more of a part of it. The people are all really awesome and I think it would be a very rewarding experience to give back to the club. I'm a hard worker and I'm also very good at managing my time. I'm very organized and I like to make sure that things get done effectively and on time. 

I would like to improve upon the number of intro classes offered. I think that a lot of new members would love to get involved with climbing and kayaking, but since intro classes are only offered maybe twice a semester, they lose interest. I love to teach and I am hoping to be allowed to lead some learn to climb trips in the near future - I will always be grateful for that first into class that got me hooked!

I am super enthusiastic about the Outdoors Club and I would love to be given the opportunity to help out with anything that I can.  Thanks for reading over my application!</td>
