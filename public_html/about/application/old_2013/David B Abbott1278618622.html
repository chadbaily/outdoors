    <td>Oh I suppose there was Boy Scouts back in the day (meh). Not really a club but I would go trail blazing / maintenance about once a month in high school with some friends. I also did quite a bit of trail running with XC.. I ought to pick that back up..
I can't say that I was involved in too many clubs mainly because they weren't offered. But in high school I was more outdoor service oriented like participating in Habitat, and then just with friends/volunteers.</td>

important info: I lust climbing.
I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of fitting new climbers with harnesses, shoes, etc. based from what information other officers have taught me. I also find myself teaching friends all the time about getting started, belaying and technique. ABCDEF</td>

Over the years it feels like I mastered the art of blister bandaging.

I've never backpacked longer than two days, I can organize myself but not sure I'm ready yet to organize a group of people.</td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>The desire for becoming an officer has really been off and on. Personally, the Outdoors club was really there for me during a really difficult point in my life and I found a lot of comfort from it. Just the sheer dynamics of how the club worked and its purpose was just really intriguing that I felt it picked me up when times were harsh. So ideally I would love to give back to the club however I could.
I've also made really close friends through the club, and I really enjoy meeting new people in gear room/trips and finding out what wild shenanigans they had been up to. Also, I find myself telling a minimum of three new people every week about the club and how to join because I like it that much. So I feel being an officer would really aid my ability of reaching out to people in the club and outside the club and helping them benefit from it as much as possible. I found myself leading hikes because I recognize that there is a large portion of the club aren't too active, but like to hike; so it would get 'newer' people involved more with the club. I see that I'm rambling, but for this segment I feel as an officer I would do well as I already reach out to people and foresee being an officer allowing me to stretch a little farther.
Also, I always find myself in gear room. I absolutely love gear room, there's just something about that dark little dorm room that just makes my day, and the people. So I feel I'd be really great at assisting others at gear room.
More to the point of my "iffy-ness". I've only been an active member for the last semester, so it felt odd wanting to be an officer if I've been in the club for such a short period. However, I've come to realize and talking with others have made me see that if I only have two years left at UVa and I want to help the club, then hell that's two solid years that I could do it! I would love to help the club and it's members in whatever way I can; so that they can find similar comfort and delight through the club. .. I guess if you've talked to me before the rambling ought not be too surprising :)

I feel I could add a great deal to the club. I feel that I'm a fairly responsible and timely individual that can be counted on. Now, from my almost weekly visits to gear room I have developed an understanding for the inner-workings, so I could definitely be a good asset as a quartermaster.. Through the love of climbing I'd also really like to lead intro trips in order for others to learn how great it is and to get people who haven't been climbing climbing. Also, I find myself looking for new and adventurous climbing loc's of which open up more options for people rather than peak (plus, outside climbing.. ohh yeah). In addition, I kept finding myself coming across events that would be able to get a larger number of people from the club involved; such that being able to reach out to a wider portion or even the more 'unactive' portion of the club as being something that I could deliver.

I personally love the club as is, but I'm really interested in finding out the inner workings of it to fully understand how it works (might be able to understand need for improvements better). I feel the club could be improved by producing more intro trips (though I recognize this could wind up making me lose a seat on a trip :x , but it's probably worth it.. plus during the semester I check my email every hour for club trips..) and shorter hiking trips. I've thought a club meeting could be interesting .. Not really sure what would be talked about.. so maybe instead just a get together of sorts that way people with similar interests could get connected and lead trips for it.. It's a tricky situation but advertisement for the club isn't really out there, other than word of mouth (often mine) and club day.. but it's the same dilemma of the club expanding too large. And honestly, word of mouth is strong enough for this club, why wouldn't someone join it.

Long story short.. even though you already read the long story:
I feel I'd be a really strong addition to the club as an officer. Even though I'm not currently an officer I find myself reaching out to others and doing what I can to find ways of getting people involved. Such that, as an officer I could see my capability and the clubs increase.

Cheers,
David</td>
