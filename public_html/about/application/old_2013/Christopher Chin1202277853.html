    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I love this club. It is the only non job activity/group that I make it a point to always devote time to and I would love if I could take a more active role in helping organize and run the club. I can share with the club my enthusiasm for the outdoors as well as my creativity. In terms of improvements, hopefully as an officer I can gain a better understanding of the inner workings of the budget and expenses in order to help improve both. </td>
