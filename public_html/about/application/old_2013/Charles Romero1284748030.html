  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>Fly fishing - I've been fly fishing since I can remember, but only recently started getting into it. I'm not _quite_ an expert, but I'm well experienced.

I've also done minimal work (a long time ago) helping repair trails.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I'd like to promote fishing within the club. I'm also a fan of the snowsports we're doing, but revising how those are done is less pressing to me.

Actually...I thought about waiting to submit an application as I'll be busy this year (last year of classes, then it's all research...which should be more flexible), but as you're looking for officers, and I do want to be one, I can find time for it. Then when Spring comes and others are leaving, I'll have even more time to contribute.</td>
