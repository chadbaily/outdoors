    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I would like to be an officer of Outdoors because I love the club and all of the opportunities it has given me. I have met some of my favorite people at UVA through the club and have engaged in activities I would otherwise not have had the chance to try. I have had such positive experiences with the club that I would like to give back to it and its members. I have been, and would like to continue, generating interest in the club by non-members and galvanizing members to lead trips that they are interested in. My enthusiasm for tapping into the resource that is Outdoors is genuine and therefore pretty contagious in my experience. I would continue to raise interest in the club as well as bring a new point of view to the group of officers as the club continues to evolve. I think the club can be improved by a larger number of its members taking the initiative to lead trips in their area of expertise, and I would do my best to encourage that to happen.</td>
