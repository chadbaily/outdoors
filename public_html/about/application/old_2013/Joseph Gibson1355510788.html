    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I founded the UVa Slackline Club this year, and the club already has over 30 members. Because I have gone through the process of founding a club, I understand the UVa CIO rules and protocol. 

I'm leading an Alternative Spring Break trip to Grand Canyon National Park this year (I was a participant last year). Duties involve booking group plane tickets, coordinating vehicle rental and other travel logistics, organizing volunteer efforts, and managing a bank account. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Although I may not be the guy in the club who is free-soloing El Cap on the weekends or thru-hiking the AT over summer break, I definitely think the club would benefit from my managerial and organizational skills. I'm nitpicky, organized, and thorough, traits which have benefitted me in my various pursuits. At the same time, I think my energy and enthusiasm could be used to promote the club and boost participation. It seems like a lot of people join the club but rarely borrow gear or go on trips because they might be timid or unsure about certain activities or club protocol. I think more workshops and basic skills classes would appeal to the sizable portion of members who have little outdoors experience. </td>
