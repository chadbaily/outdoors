    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I owe so much to the club. Outdoors has let me continue my climbing throughout college, with frequent trips to the New and the Red. I also have been getting more into Mountain Biking, all thanks to the club's gear rental policy in addition to being able to take my Dad climbing and biking for the first time this past year. 

I feel like I have a lot of specialized knowledge about rock climbing that I could bring to the club-- teaching sport classes, leading intro classes, and getting more trips going outdoors. After 7 years of teaching these skills at Passages, I am an experienced teacher who brings not only expertise but passion for the sport. I hope to soon reach the same level of knowledge in Mountain Biking so that I can branch into leading trips that sport as well. However, I also understand the inherent risk involved in these activities, allowing me to always manage that risk and keep people safe. 

I believe the club is a fantastic resource available to students and the wider Charlottesville community, although I would like to see more students taking advantage of what the club has to offer. As an officer, I would seek to involve more of the UVa community in Outdoors.
