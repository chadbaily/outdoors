    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I work at Chanco on the James, a summer camp in Surry, VA (which is about an hour east of Richmond). As a staff member I supervise and help children swim, kayak, canoe, sail, hike, and do zip lines and high and low ropes elements. I love my job because aside from the reward of working with amazing kids, it is the best thing ever to chill out and live outside all summer.

I also work at Poplar Ridge, UVA's own on-grounds high and low ropes course. 

This summer I worked with Outdoor Rec in the rental center where I rented people all sorts of outdoors gear, which gave me a knowledge base regarding an assortment of outdoors gear as well as the rental process. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer because I really want to contribute more to a club that I've been a member of my entire time at UVA. I want to be involved in behind-the-scenes work that makes this organization tick.

Being able to access gear room would be a huge plus for being an officer. As it is, I tend to not lead trips that require gear because gear room can be such as a hassle. I understand that with the privilege of being able to get into a gear room comes the responsibility of leading gear rooms, but I am totally happy to contribute that to the club, especially since that time each week is so crucial. If I were to pick one thing for the club to improve on, it would be faster and more efficient gear rooms. Hopefully as an officer I could help make this happen!</td>
