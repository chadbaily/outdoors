    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I would love to give back to the club that has already given so much to me. Even though I only became significantly active in the club this year, I have already made some great friends and had wonderful experiences. Everyone is willing to lend a hand to help you learn new skills and I would love to take a part in helping out new members as well. I also would like to contribute as much as I can to helping people appreciate and learn about the wilderness around us. I particularly enjoy taking on a challenge from which I can learn just as much as I teach others. 
As for the duties I am interested in, I am going to select all because I am willing to help out anywhere. The areas I have the most experience in, however, would be advising leaders and handling gear (mostly hiking/backpacking/canoeing gear).</td>
