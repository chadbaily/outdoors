    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I wasn't involved in any serious outdoors programs. I would snowboard and sea kayak here and there, but I wasn't involved in any particular organization. This is the first outdoors club that i have been a part of. I have had some great experiences and learned a lot about the different activities from the people around me.</td>

    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I was treasurer of my class in high school as well as treasurer of Red Cross club. I was also the coordinator for community service for my high school. At UVA , I haven’t had many major leadership roles as I am trying to move up in the ranks. Captain of club sports team and President of the Pet pals program at Madison house are two things that I would like to be during my fourth year. I am the service chair for my fraternity, PSP, currently. I am organizing a service event for next month right now. Obviously you guys know that I like leading trips for the club. I have 5 hikes lined up for this spring that I am pretty excited about!</td>

    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>This is not my forte. I did take a roll class and went on a few of Emily Powell's beginner trips. It was successful in that i survived. It was unsuccessful in that i had to wet exit...a lot.</td>

    <td>Mountain biking experience</td>
    <td>I started with some of Lynn's beginner trips and then some of Sam's intermediate stuff (Ohill, Walnut Creek hard stuff). It is a lot of fun, and I want to continue biking regularly. Last trip I watched Lynn replace a tube for my tire, and I realized that I need to start learning bike maintenance so I can go out and bike and know what to do if something happens. I pretty much only know basic stuff that I learned for the rickshaws I drove  the last 2 summers, but plan on learning much more in the near future.</td>

    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>Day hike wise i know of a lot of good loops around here. I plan on leading sherando lake next weekend, then 3 ridges, the priest and the climax will be the 26 mi day hike in may. :)
AS far as backpacking, i am going to start sectioning the AT this summer!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Caving experience</td>
    <td>I would not lead my own caving trip, but i do like leading trips to the semi-annual conventions. WNS has prevented me from going this spring, but as soon as caves open again, i will lead more! My experience would just be the conventions i have been to thus far.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I pretty much snowboard, but want to learn how to ski soon. i led a trip to aspen last year (don't remember if i made it official or not) and one to Utah this year. They were fantastic. I couldn't make it to snowshoe this year, but that will have to change next season. I am comfortable on anything WV has to throw at me and double blacks/bowls out west.

    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I did an internship (conservation intern was my formal title) last summer at First landing State Park. This summer I am going to work at the Mountain Lake Biology Station for some field work.  The Station is in the Blue Ridge not too far way. Hopefully I will learn about the ecology around here!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>The main reason I want to be an officer is that I want to give back to the club. I really didn't like UVA my first semester, but after my trip to Aspen in the spring, I realized that I really enjoyed the activities and friends I had made. A huge part of that was due to outdoors club. Not liking the party scene so much first year, I was able to escape on the weekends to hike, bike, climb, or whatever. I am so happy that I had a chance to experience backpacking, climbing and etc because I will be doing outdoors activities for the rest of my life. Looking back, I don’t know how I enjoyed life without ever having experienced a real weekend outdoors. 
I also have to give credit to the people that I met on these trips. I think outdoors club is great networking system in which people that are experienced or interested in outdoors activities can enjoy them together. In my case, having gone backpacking with grad students that have much more backpacking experience was amazing. I learned not only about the backpacking process, such as packing a backpack, but about them and the things they have done. 
This club has helped me with my college transition, and I want help the club so hopefully others can have a similar experience. 
I hope that I can help, not only by leading trips, but also with club management. I know there is more going on behind the scenes, and I want to be a part of that. I specifically would like to be a treasurer. I do have previous experience being a treasurer, and I know that the clubs budget is very limited right now. I hope that the current treasurers can train me before they leave, so hopefully things with student council will run smoothly and the club can operate on a budget to support the trips. 
As far as the club being improved, the only thing that I could ever see as being a problem is the inconsistency in trips being posted. I know there are some weeks where there are 1-3 trips posted and some with 10. I know that you motivate trip leaders with the money back deal, but maybe there are other ways too. This is something that should be discussed if you think it’s important. One thing that would be easy is to have officers lead some trip leading workshops. I think the real reason people don’t lead trips is because they are too scared and don’t really know the procedure. 
Also, I know the club doesn’t have as much money as it did in the past. I don’t know how you do fundraising, but something that I think could be a good idea is to have an alumni (people who have money) newsletter for people who used to be in the club. It can be a newsletter talking about cool trips, gear, whatever. Then at least former outdoors club alumni will see it and could possibly donate money if they choose to. Again, just an idea to throw around.
