    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to become an officer so that I can fully appreciate the outdoor club culture. I want to volunteer my time in the gear room. I want to meet new people and get them ramped up about new adventures, new horizons, and new experiences. I want to learn from other club members.

Outdoor club is the best club at uva and becoming an officer will allow me to make it even better through my leadership, enthusiasm, and the fact that I will be around for at least 4 more years. I hope to help expand the outdoor club beyond UVa to the greater Charlottesville area by collaborating with local clubs and stores. 

The club can be improved in 2 ways:
1) By increasing our number and student representation. Everyone who does anything outdoors should be in uva outdoors club.
2) By providing routine adventures for beginners, to get people involved and excited. Make these flexible but standardized. Keep records so that we can show UVA CIO we have done a lot (not just who went, but who went and kept doing it, maybe we could team up with local retailers) this will promote the University and maybe local stores to increase their sponsorship. For example I never would have gotten into kayaking without Big Mike's pool sessions.
