    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer because I plan on being around for at least 3 more years and being active in the club the whole time.  Love a lot of the stuff we do and have a lot to contribute to the club.

Would be able to help especially with climbing.  Also will be able to lead other various other fun trips- i.e. scuba, hiking, and whatever.

How can the club be improved?  Not sure, everything seems pretty good..</td>
