    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I became fairly knowledgeable in climbing, mountain biking, and snowboarding. I think my technical knowledge can be helpful in ensuring the safety of the club members. I like variety of outdoor activities and I would like to share my passion with other members in the club and reach out to get more people to join the club. I've already led climbing, bouldering, mountain biking, hiking, snowboarding, slacklining, canoeing, and skydiving trips, but I hope to bring even more variety of events to the club.</td>
