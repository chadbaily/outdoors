    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I have been in the Outdoor Club since the fall of my second year, and it has really been one of the best organizations on grounds for allowing me to meet new people and explore Charlottesville and the surrounding area. It has also allowed me to try and get involved in outdoor activities that I never thought I would be able to do. I would like to get further involved in the club to be able to continue to try new activities, meet more like-minded people, and give back to the organization. Additionally, I am thinking about pursuing field biology post-graduation, so I think I could use some more familiarity with outdoor gear.</td>
