    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to share my passion for the outdoors with other UVA students and members of the community.  I would add another avid backpacker to the clubs list I am very exciting about leading lots more awesome backpacking trips of all skill levels in the future.  I also will be setting up slacklining adventures on the lawn and other places I think this would expand the clubs offerings for backpacking and slacklining trips.  I feel that something the club could improve would be to offer more opportunities for beginners in all activities.  I hope to help with this by offering intro backpacking trips and day hikes.</td>
