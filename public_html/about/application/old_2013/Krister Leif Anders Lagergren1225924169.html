    <td>I'm a big time skier. I've been every winter about twice a year with my family. Usually we'll go once over Christmas break, ski 3-5 days and once in February or March and ski 2-3 days. Our main mountains are Okemo, Stratton, and Bromley of Vermont. I can ski black-diamonds, but have yet to try any real double-blacks. </td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>There are a few reasons as to why I would like to become an officer of the Outdoors Club. First of all, if I were to choose only one club at UVA that I enjoy the most and want to see prosper, it would be hands-down the Outdoors Club. No doubt joining this club was the one of the best decisions I made here at UVA. 

I have been told that two qualities I carry around with me are reliability and responsibility. As an officer I will make sure that my duties are carried out without trouble. I am a first year, and am still learning more about the club, so I can't say much about how to improve it yet. But I don't think that that puts a stop on what I can contribute. 

I may not be able to lead any of the more intense and elaborate of the club's adventures, but I can fill in the small trips that may go missing later in the year. Though I'm not the best mountain biker, I feel I can lead some beginner mountain biking trips around Ohill. I could also lead some Hiking and possibly some community service trips around UVA. Either way, while some of the more experienced officers and leaders can head up the trips that require a bit more knowledge, I would be able to keep up some of the smaller quick trips that really don't require much. 

I also would like to mention that I was a lifeguard for the Cavalier Golf & Yacht Club as a summer job, and I am Red-Cross certified in First-Aid and CPR. So if something were to go wrong, I would at least have some knowledge on what to do and how to treat the situation. Though I've only had to use these skills for minor cuts and water-rescue, I would gladly go back and refresh my memory for the club. 

In summary, I greatly admire the Outdoors club and want to see it improve. I may not have all that much experience, but I can fill in the less extensive trips. I may even be able to lead a skiing trip if someone else can drive. I can bring commitment and responsibility to the club, as well as some general knowledge in the area of first aid and CPR. 

I thank the Outdoors Club for all its done in the months I've been here at UVA. I hope that soon I will be able to become a bigger part of this club and be able to do for others what it has done for me.
