    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer so I can more effectively get other people engaged in outdoorsy activities. Most of my own efforts will be directed towards climbing. I have and will lead lots of beginner climbing trips to get people into the sport. Eventually, once I have the proper experience and qualification, “learn to lead climb trips” will be on my agenda as well. I have found that getting an officer to open the gear room for random trips that I can fit into my schedule has gotten very tedious, so access to the gear room would be a plus.  I would also be willing to lead a trip leader workshop if I’m able.  Really, I relish the idea of bringing the outdoors to people without those huge, inhibiting fees, along with gaining and passing on as much experience (and fun) as possible.</td>
