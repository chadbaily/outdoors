I hope to increase to class IV and V whitewater over the next couple of years, and look forward to helping beginners progress as well. I have tentative plans to start doing at least one beginner kayaking trip a month to help other people get into kayaking. </td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer because I think this club is probably the best thing about UVA and I know I can help keep it that way. As for what I can add, nothing more than leadership, passion and experience. I'm usually a laid back, go with the flow guy  but I've been in real life survival situations, so I know the importance of logistics, planning every contingency. Overcoming the logistics battle, and ensuring adventures are safety are the two major hurdles that have to be crossed before everyone can go have fun, I'm good at those things. 

Kayaking is my passion, I would rather be on a river than anywhere else. I know it's the same way for many others in the club but it's rare to find that kind of passion among the  students. The outdoors club can help members find an outdoor activity to be passionate about and the officers should facilitate that process if by no other means then by example. 

That being said, it seems that the club gets focused in on the technical, difficult to learn activities like kayaking, climbing, and snow sports. I don't think we have enough social trips like camping and stargazing, primarily because the trip leaders are as passionate about their certain activity as I am about kayaking. We should work to either include these easier, more inclusive activities into other adventures to allow more club members to participate in outdoors. If this isn't something that will happen naturally, then the officers should work together to come up with plans for such adventures. That is the only improvement that I can think of. </td>
