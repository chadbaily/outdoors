    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I never quite excelled as the outdoorsy-type in my younger years. From when I was a mini-webelo in cub scouts, I lost interest quickly and stopped boy scouts in ninth grade. My extent of outdoors exposure in high school consisted of playing sports: mainly soccer and tennis, as well as recreation kayaking on the James. Entering UVa as a first year, I began participating in numerous trips, but interaction stalled during second semester by another time commitment. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I feel like a cliché college senior boasting endlessly for college applications about how once upon a time I served on this and that; However, I honestly feel that I made an impact at my school as the Vice president for National Honor Society. I received most of the workload to organize, inform, and call many events, and while I resented this at the time, given hindsight, it has supplied me with priceless skills- people interaction, teamwork, and planning- that I now value highly. </td>

    <td>Climbing experience</td>
    <td>I took an intro-class with Chris Chin. Thats all she wrote. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I have kayaked for recreation on the James. There were no rapids involved. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Mountain biking experience</td>
    <td>I have ridden trails at Pocahontas Park in Richmond, Peaksview in Lynchburg, and a few times on RTF in Charlottesville. While I do not consider myself an expert by any means, I know that I am a smart and confident rider. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>I led two hikes recently- One to Crabtree falls, another to Cedar Run. I consider myself fairly experienced with dayhikes as I have hiked many trails like three ridges, devils marbleyard, old rag, and many more in the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge parkway area.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I ski fairly well and have an unmatched urge in learning to snowboard. I attended two or three trips last year, and I am in the process of organizing/leading two this winter to snowshoe (hopefully weekend trips over the winter break, and my biggest hurdle is lodging at the moment).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I run every single week outside, whether it be cloudy or sunny. I have recently began road biking- while it is more a hobby at this point, it does fall under the outdoors category. Frisbee golf/ultimate frisbee. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td> I love people. The friendships formed and the number of interesting people I have met on trips thus far has been incredible. Whether it be leading trips or as an officer, or both- I want to distance myself from cliche college greek life and increase my participation with worthwhile activities that outdoors offers. While I may not be the most experienced in outdoors activities, I believe that I am an excellent communicator and organizer; the club needs this type of person for the sheer amount of members. I know that I can help the club by involving more people in the activities. As a first year, I was very apprehensive about joining adventures which I knew little or nothing about; I also know many people who joined and never participated, and others who have joined but do not want to lead. I feel like I can make these people feel more welcomed, interested, and able to participate with outdoors in the future.</td>
