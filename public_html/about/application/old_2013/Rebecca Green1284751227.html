    <td>Climbing experience</td>
    <td>Sport climbing--5.7 at most.  I have climbed at Rocky Top once, at Peak a couple times, and at Rise Up once.  I would like to do more, but Thursday nights are not always good for me and this is when most of the climbing trips are!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>Yes!  I love hiking, mostly just short day hikes because I usually cannot take a whole weekend off (even though I would like to!).  With Army ROTC, I have done rucking, which is probably very similar to backpacking (although I cannot say I have officially backpacked).  I also love trail running.   </td>

    <td>Caving experience</td>
    <td>Not yet, unfortunately.  I wanted to go this weekend on the WV trip, but then I realized that I had scheduled a recycling program with my hall Sunday morning.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>Not much of a snow person, I like water sports!  I have done a Winter Survival Skills trip with Roland and snowshoed a bit and learned some cool survival tricks (i.e. building a snow house=super awesome).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I have done some environmental service (for example, a river clean-up near my house and the recycling program at UVa), but I would like to try to do more of it.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I am a very responsible, honest person who would love to gain more experience working outside.  Becoming an officer of the outdoors club would be a great way to do this.  Being outside is something I love to do, and gaining this experience will be crucial for my career (hopefully!) as a physician's assistant in the Army by learning survival  and outdoors skills, budgeting, and learning more about the equipment for different outdoors activities.   
I provide:  enthusiasm for learning new things and gaining crucial leadership experience, good organizational skills and patience (the gear room would especially benefit from this!), good suggestions such as having more varying hours for the gear room (for example, I have classes at those times on T/Tr, so having gear room on Monday and Thursday may be better), leading various more day hikes/trips/runs so that more people will be encouraged to get involved in the club because short trips like these do not require a big commitment, good responsiveness to e-mails, a great attitude!   
The Club provides: great experience learning about the outdoors and outdoors sports, Wilderness First Aid Training, fun memories. 
Thanks for considering me as a candidate!!</td>
