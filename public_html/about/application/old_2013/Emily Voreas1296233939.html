    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I'm obsessed with the Outdoors, and would love to be a part of the inside planning of the club.  I can help with organizing and leading the large trips (I have a tendency to only lead huge trips that require intense organization... but I can also try to lead some smaller trips).  I think the club could use some more diverse trips, but other than that, I think it runs pretty smoothly.</td>
