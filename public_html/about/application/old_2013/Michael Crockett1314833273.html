    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I Scouted for a long time, just barely squeaking out Eagle before I turned 18, then did a NOLS semester in the Patagon on my year off.  I'm also the High Commander of the Bobcat Brigade which is the extreme outdoors division of VASST.  I guess VASST is outdoor related, so that too.  I was also a member of the Wampuscats, which was an informal gathering of dudes in my hometown of Gloucester, VA.  That group of friends was centered around "Man-Meat Thursdays" and weekend, backyard camp outs.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I was a Senior Patrol Leader in Scouts for a while—six months or something.  I also lead a week-long instructor-independent small group trip while doing NOLS Patagoinia.  Like I said, High Commander of the Bobcat Brigade.  Oh yeah, senior year of high school I was co-captain of my tennis team.  We were really  pretty awful.</td>

    <td>Mountain biking experience</td>
    <td>I have like seven club bikes at my house right now which is really ridiculous.  I've ridden Walnut Creek and Ohill plus the RTF north til Barracks pretty extensively.  I lead a trip to Sherando recently which was a clobber and a half.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I really appreciate what this club offers and I feel that Outdoors is one of the reasons that makes school tolerable.  I like to be an integral part of what I am involved with which is why I'd like to help run the club.  I really can't think of any real faults with the club, and I'd like to learn more about the workings before I try to advise improvements.  Also it's 725 so I'll just say I like gear especially if there's a financial backer and I keep the ski house's finances.  I'm just gonna go ahead and submit this.  Also being an officer would make bike maintenance much easier.  That's a Lynn initiative.  Thanks, peace, see you at the New regardless</td>
