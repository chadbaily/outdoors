Eric,
I have attached a pro-purchase form as well as current price list.  Please
follow the pro-purchase rules and guidelines.  If any of your students have
interest in buying Sierra Designs product please direct them towards Blue
Ridge Mountain Sports.  Let me know if I can help out in any other way.

Subject: Sierra Designs, pro-purchase order

Mr. Hammond,
   I am an officer with Outdoors at UVa, an outdoors organization based at 
the University of Virginia (www.outdoorsatuva.org).  We last ordered 
equipment from Sierra Designs though their pro-purchase program in the 
spring of 2005.  We would like to order some additional tents for our 
organization.  Do we need to apply for a pro-purchase again?  Please let me 
know if you need any additional information.
