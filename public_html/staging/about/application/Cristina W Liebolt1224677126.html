    <td>Girl Scouts when I was a little one. Then I did a 3 week Outward Bound program in Southeastern Utah -- hiking, rappelling, white-water rafting, truly a blast. I also am a member of Mountain Techs (online survey site where you chat about the Outdoors, review products, get points, and when you have enough points, they send you free stuff!)</td>

    <td>Alternative Spring Break (ASB), Site Leader -- last year I had so much fun on my trip to New Orleans as a group member, that this year I am co-leading my own trip to New Orleans this spring break. 

University Mediation Services (UMS) -- offers free mediation services to UVA students. Mediation is increasingly used across the world as a positive way to resolve conflict. At UVA, we are used for everything from roommate disagreements to sexual assault cases. Some parties contact us on their own, some cases are referred to us by the Deans, and some cases are referred to us from the UJC. 

Sexual Assault Peer Advocacy (SAPA) -- Peer education group that seeks to educate the University community about sexual violence, and provides support to sexual assault survivors.</td>

    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>Lots! After hiking for years at my camp in Maine (mostly along the Appalachian trail), I did a three week backpacking trip with the Outward Bound program in summer 2004. It was the real deal and I loved it and learned so much about how to survive in the true wilderness. The next summer I went trekking through the Himalayas in Ladakh, India, a beautiful region right under Tibet. Breathing in the thin mountain air was an experience and I hope to go back. 
      Since then, I have not done any more group hiking (except, of course, with dear Outdoors Club), but have had time to do some independant hiking. Two summers ago (2007), I worked on a dude ranch, the A Bar A, in Encampment, Wyoming. The middle-of-nowhere location meant inviting mountains beckoned to me daily. It was great to be able to safely take off on one's own out in America's grand West.
   Right now I am in Lyon, France studying for the semester, and as we have fall break next week, I leave tomorrow to go hiking in the Swiss Alps. I have been dreaming about this opportunity for a while now so I am looking forward to it!</td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>My first year I did a few outdoors club activities, but it was last semester (my second year) that I really fell in love with the Club, via the ski crowd. The club provides such a great way for Outdoors enthusiasts to get together and learn from each other. You're never going to know everything about the Outdoors, since Mother Nature is always changing, so it's important, not to mention more fun, to learn from others. Outdoors Club at UVA provides a wonderful social network, and one that I've missed while being abroad in France this semester. In reflecting on what I miss most at UVA, and therefore what I want to put my energy into when I get back to school, Outdoors Club comes out on top. I personally want to increase my outdoors knowledge, and what better way than to be in-the-know of Outdoors at UVA! I also hope to take a Wilderness First Aid course, and I see that as one of the benefits to being an officer. 
     I think as a girl, I can help encourage other girls to participate in the Club, as some areas are a bit male-dominated. Also, being from New York City, I wasn't exactly born in the woods (though I'm a nature girl at heart), so I'd like to encourage those who think Outdoors Club is "too intense" to at least try it out. 
     I also hope to keep up the social aspect through pot-lucks and other social events, as I think the network is really what keeps people enthusiastic and wanting to participate. I love to do new things, so I would be up for leading hikes to places where people haven't gone before. I would also be up for managing workshops for leaders, and organizing ways to offer wilderness training courses at UVA. 
    It seems to me like the Club has improved a lot in the past year, by encouraging people to lead, providing leader workshops, improving communication. As with all CIO's, I think it's always great to improve presence on Campus. Perhaps selling tee-shirts or even having an Outdoors Club bar night (or cook-out might be more outdoors-style) would help. I know more of the 600+ members of Outdoors Club can always get involved!</td>
