    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I have been involved Top of Virginia Search and Rescue since 1999 and have been a member of the Blue Ridge Mountain Rescue Group since 2003.  In both of these groups, I have gained valuable experience outdoors and have bettered my skills at orienteering, knots, semi-technical rescue, etc.  I am also a state-certified Field Team Leader (in which I am responsible for leading groups of volunteers on field teams in search of the missing person), am certified at Wilderness First Aid, and am a state-certified Emergency Medical Technician.

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I have been a member of the Outdoors Club since the spring and have participated in several activites.  Thus far, I have enjoyed all the activities and have met some very interesting, dynamic individuals.  As a result, I would like to become more involved with the club.

Furthermore, I have been active with search and rescue for several years and have led field teams in fourteen different search and rescue missions.  Such experiences have given me the skills that would make me a viable candidate for an officer position in the Outdoors Club.  </td>
