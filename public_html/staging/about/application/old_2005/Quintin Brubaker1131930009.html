    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I've been an RA for the past two years. That's entailed a good share of responsibility, including managing lots of e-mail. But it's intrinsic value is lost on me lately, so I won't be doing it again next year. I want to shift those responsibility-efforts to something that does have intrinsic value for me - outdoors.
I also helped organize Days on the Lawn last spring.</td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Outdoors is the only extracurricular I've done and identified with ever since I've been at UVa. I like the idea of giving back to the club. I've lead a handfull of trips over the past two years, but I'll be compelled to lead even more - which I hope for - if doing the officer thing.
I don't really have duty favorites - I'd be happy to take on whatever tasks needs, after talking with whoever else will be officers.</td>
