    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>Last year I spent a lot of time experimenting with different clubs at UVA, and it took me a while to find groups that I wanted to be involved in. Therefore, my leadership positions at UVA are far from impressive. The only official leadership role I've held here is Calculus Review Session Leader, which involves teaching an AMPA 109 review session every Monday night. 

In contrast, in high school I held a lot of leadership positions in service organizations. I was co-president of the Human Relations Council, President of a Peer Counseling Group, and secretary of the National Honor Society. Also, I want to mention that I was an exchange student in Spain during my sophomore year of high school, which demonstrates my passion for exploration, discovery, and independence.  </td>

    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I do mostly flat-water paddling, although I really want to get into whitewater. I enjoy sea kayaking as well. Also, I'm comfortable in a canoe and would love to get a canoe-camping trip together next spring. 

I haven't done much paddling in Virginia yet, but I've paddled flat-water sections of the Farmington River, Bantam Lake, and Lake McDunnah in Connecticut as well as the Long Island Sound in Rhode Island. I also did some paddling/surfing/swimming to fetch the kayak in the Outer Banks :) </td>

    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>Hiking and backpacking is where most of my experience lies. I've hiked extensively in the White Mountains in New Hampshire, the Green Mountains in Vermont, everywhere in Connecticut, and I'm slowly building up my Virginia repetoir. Last spring break I went backpacking in Southern California with the Club, and this summer I backpacked a section of the AT in Connecticut and Massachussetts.  </td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I love Outdoors at UVA and I'll do my best to keep it alive after all of you guys leave :( I think UVA has an outstanding program, and I'm especiially impressed with the way the website makes everything so organized and user-freindly. 

Hopefully, I can use my enthusiasm for the outdoors to encourage others to join and lead trips. While I recognize that my experience in many areas is limited, I hope to improve my outdoor knowledge/skill in coming years. Also, I want to look for a new way to provide incentive for members to lead trips in their areas of expertice, therefore taking some of the pressure off of the officers and simultaneously increasing the variety and the diversity of club trips. </td>
