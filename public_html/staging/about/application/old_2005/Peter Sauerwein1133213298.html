  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>The Outdoors Club fulfills an important mission; many students do not have the chance to experience the Virginia outdoors because of contraints on transportation, gear, and either leaders or people with similiar interests, and the Club removes those constraints.  Gaining an appreciation for the environment and meeting people outside of normal social circles are only a few of the things the Outdoors Club has to offer.  The Club has been expanding rapidly, but has even more potential; more social functions, perhaps moving out of the basement gear room and expanding storage, encouraging more people to lead trips.  Being involved in realizing this potential would definitely be exciting and challenging, with the additional bonus of exploring the outdoors and helping others who may have not had the opportunity or means to do the same.</td>
