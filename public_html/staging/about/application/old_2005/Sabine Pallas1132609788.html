    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I love the Outdoor Club and all the possibilities it offers. But I'd also love to play a more important part in the club. I know a lot about gear and I can deal very well with people. I'm outgoing, frank and open to everything new.
Since I'm German I think that I could give the club some kind of a more "international touch" and I'd like to contribute my outdoor related experiences from Germany and the alps. 
On the other hand I'm very interested in discovering the US (I've already done this a lot!!) which would lead to very nice club trips and activities. </td>
