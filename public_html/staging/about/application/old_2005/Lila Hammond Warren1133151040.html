    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>Besides this club, I havn't been in any organized clubs, however, I do consider myself outdoors-y :) I grew up in the country and go canoeing, fishing, horse-back-riding, and hiking often at home. I live five minutes from the Shenandoah and I can see Sky Meadows National Park from my front porch. Last year I went on a week-long snowshoeing trip in the Adirondacks where we summitted five of the 46 peaks over 5000 ft. I also enjoy snowboarding and have been out to Colorado. Overall, I'm really enthusiastic and passionate about the outdoors. </td>

I can't think of a better combination than leadership and the outdoors - that's why I'd like to be an officer. </td>
