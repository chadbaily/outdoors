    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I have grown up in the outdoors.  I actually haven't been involved in that many organized groups since I was busy playing sports and participating in other after school activities throughout my school career.  During the summers, I went to a number of Adventure Camps growing up that introduced me to canoeing, mountain biking, backpacking (overnight camping), climbing among other activities.

For the past two summers I have worked at Shiloh Quaker Camp in Stanardsville, Va where we spend 4 days of every week on the trail either hiking, climbing or canoeing (and sometimes doing service).  Therefore, I have experience planning and organizing trips for groups of people.  
With Shiloh, I was trained as a top-rope instructor for rock climbing (though unfortunately my certification expires at the end of this spring) and therefore have experience setting up simply top rope climbs.  I have backpacked extensively in this area and therefore am quite comfortable leading camping trips.  I would also be willing and excited to lead some canoeing trips with another able-bodied person.  I might do a NOLs course this summer, but I currently have no experience with anything that involved.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I held a number of leadership positions in High School including President of my junior and senior class, Captain of the Girl's cross-country team my junior and senior years, Director of a service organization called Reach at my high school, Secretary of NHS, SCA representative junior and senior year.  However, I do not currently hold any leadership positions at UVA.  I am looking into becoming more involved with the Anthro-Society in the upcoming semesters and plan to do Alternative Spring Break this spring and could see myself organizing some sort of trip through that organization.  Basically, I have held leadership positions before, but currently am not involved in too many organized activities at UVa.      </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Climbing experience</td>
    <td>I am most comfortable doing top-rope climbing.  I was certified by Earth Treks in Maryland as a top-rope site instructor (though my certification expires at the end of this spring).  I comfortably climb 5.8 on top rope and like climbing 5.9 and 5.10 as well (though 5.10 is a definite challenge depending on the types of move...I can climb slabs where friction is the key a lot better than dynamic routes).  I need to climb more!  And then I would be more confident than I am.    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I can maneuver a kayak but my experience is very minimal and therefore I am really only comfortable on white water in a sit-on-top kayak because I cannot roll.  I have paddled the Shennandoah before (which is quite easy) ... so basically the experience I have is negligible.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Mountain biking experience</td>
    <td>I don't mountain bike that much and I do not have shocks on my bike.  But I did do some mountain biking growing up and am therefore comfortable riding trails, especially at places like walnut creek.  I do need more experience in this area, but I can hold my own on a bike.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>This is where I feel I have the most experience.  I have spent the last two summers in the woods hiking and backpacking with lots of kids.  Therefore, I am used to planning and organizing trips and being responsible for a lot of people.  I know this area (especially the part of Shennandoah that is north of here) well.  I would definitely enjoy leading some overnight camping trips.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Caving experience</td>
    <td>I have been caving on several occasions and love it!  But I do not know any caves well enough to lead a caving trip.  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I really like to ski (and wouldn't mind learning how to snowboard!) both downhill and cross-country.  But I am certainly not an expert.  I didn't grow up skiing very often.  However, I am interested especially in snowshoeing and cross country skiing.  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>For years I have done projects such as pick up trash.  I have helped clean up the property at the camp where I work.  But I have never been involved with environmental service on a large scale.  This spring I will be participating in Alternative Spring Break at Port Isabel in the Chesapeake Bay.  We will be working with the Save The Bay Foundation which seems like a really great organization.  Therefore, this might give me an in on a service relationship with this organization (because I would like to become more involved.  That is why I decided to stay in Virginia for the service trip so that it might be a relationship that lasts more than a week.)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Honestly, I do not yet feel that I qualify to be an officer seeing how I have not lead any trips this year (as I had hoped when I returned to UVa this fall).  However, I would really like to get my foot in the door and lead some trips this spring (especially hiking and camping).  And, I would like to be an officer in the future (looking towards next year) for a number of reasons.  First of all, I love spending lots of time outdoors and feel that it is a great use of time.  I would like to be part of making this possible for many UVa students, because without organized activities, many people might not be able to go hiking or camping for one reason or another, whether it is the lack of transportation or the lack of people to go with.  I feel that it is very important to provide opportunities for people to experience and try things that they might not have ever done before.  And we live in a beautiful part of Virginia that should be explored!  I also enjoy being on the organizing end of trips and such ... I kind of miss doing this from the past summer and would like to collaborate with others.  I would also just really like to have a good excuse to spend more time with some really great people.  I have met some awesome people in outdoors club but would like to know many of them better.  I feel like I could bring good energy to the group once I get my act together and start leading some trips.  I think outdoors club is a great place to channel my energy in the coming semesters.  

(A note on what duties I would be interested in as an officer: I would probably enjoy handling the gear and advising leaders most, but I also am pretty decent at handling money and would not mind doing so.  I wouldn't mind purchasing gear either as long as there was someone advising me in the areas in which I do not have as much experience, for example, I don't really know much about kayaking so I would not know what gear would be good, bad, ugly, etc.)  </td>
