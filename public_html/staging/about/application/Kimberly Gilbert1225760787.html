    <td>Other experience</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I've been a club member since my first year and have always loved the club, I've learned many new things and met so many people and have enjoyed every minute of it.  I think that this club provides an amazing experience for anyone who is looking for it, and I want to do my part to continue providing and sharing this experience with everyone else.  I can add to the club my enthusiasm for the outdoors, and organizational abilities.  I think the club can be improved by doing more trips of different kinds.  I hope to get people interested in cross-country skiing as well as do more hiking and if I can get the experience, backpacking as well.</td>
