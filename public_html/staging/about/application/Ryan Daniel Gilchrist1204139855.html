    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer so that I can have an active role in the overall planning of the club's activities. Althouogh I have led many trips and attended lots more, I feel like I could do more for the club. I would like to give something back to the club that has provided me with many friendships and wonderful experiences. 
The club could be improved with a more streamlined reimbursement plan involving a central system, perhaps online, eliminating the need for coordinating gear room schedules with officers and collecting so much paper. Also, a "Panda Support Group" should be initiated for those of us who strongly identify (and in some cases resemble) with the creature. </td>
