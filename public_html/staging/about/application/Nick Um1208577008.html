    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I have a lot of passion for Outdoors club. This club has been a big part of my college experience this year. I am applying to become an officer because I want to get more involved and contribute significantly to the club by teaching other members what I know and by continuing the club traditions. I am excited to learn more and give back to the community. These are some updates since my last application:

Led trips to Everglades, FL for canoeing (co-lead), Humpback rock hike, old rag hike, and peak (x11). I also helped teach beginners in a climbing workshop.
Adult CPR and Standard First Aid certified (want to take WFA this summer)

Thanks for your consideration.</td>
