    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I want to be an officer because I want to be more involved with the club.  I am not involved with much at the school besides this club.  I really love this club, I spend lots of time recruiting my friends to join.  I can add a sense of fun to the club with my attitude.  I can also keep the club organized, I am a very organized person.  The club can be improved by organizing the gear room a bit better.  It seems like things are just piled up in there.  Also, the website could use updating, there are many things about it that don't work as well as I would like them to.  Some of the reimbursement policies also need to get looked at and updated as necessary.  Thank you very much for reading my application and good luck with your officer choices.</td>
