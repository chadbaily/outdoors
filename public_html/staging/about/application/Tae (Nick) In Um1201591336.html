    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>Coming to UVA and joining Outdoors Club, I discovered my passion for outdoors and for the club. I dedicated so much time and effort to go to many fun trips. I am thankful for the club and for the opportunites to try new things such as mtn biking and outdoor climbing. 

I want to be an officer and contribute to the club as much as I can starting my 1st year. Although I may lack experience in leading trips, I believe that I am very passionate about the club and helping other members. Not only have I been asking most of the officers on how to become an officer myself, I have also applied and enrolled myself to APALTI to gain leadership skills for becoming an officer.

I want to dedicate part of my time at UVA for serving this club and teaching other people what I know. I want to be that person who gets up 7 in the morning to let people use the gear room. Since I will be living on grounds next year, it will be easy for me to help people with gear.

The way I see it, this club runs pretty smoothly and we are all doing an excellente job. The only problem I see is that out of 530 members only a small portion of them actually go on trips regularly. I know a person who has not gone to a single trip the entire semester and felt that it was "a waste of money". In order to improve this problem of narrow participants, we should lead more non-specialized, friendly trips such as volunteering, short hiking, and other introductory trips. I try to take 3-4 beginners to Peak to give them a sense of climbing and we should strongly encourage other members with expertise and knowledge to set up trips.

I am aware that I still need to lead 3 outdoorsy trips to qualify and I am applying to further demonstrate my interest. I intend to lead hiking/backpacking trips as soon as weather gets warmer with help of Lila so please keep that in mind. I am confident that I can contribute greatly to the club. I will bring my enthusiasm and passion for outdoors and helping people to this club. Thank you for your time.</td>
