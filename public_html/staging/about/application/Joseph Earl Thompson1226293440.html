    <td>Climbing experience</td>
    <td>All three. Sport: 5.11d redpoint. Top rope: 5.12b redpoint. trad: 5.10c/d G onsight (New/Franklin rating, not Seneca rating). Ref: Katrina Salmons, Chance Lacey, Jen Chang. I am currently not comfortable teaching trad because I don't consider my trad experience to be anything approaching extensive, though I consider almost every piece I place to be solid enough to catch a 30 footer. I have aided one route, it was a project, it will probably go free at 12+. I am not comfortable teaching trad to anyone without mechanical inclination. I consider hands-on instruction on lead belaying, lead falling, and basic anchors to be integral to instruction on sport leading, which I am comfortable teaching. I have yet to see a serious climbing injury or death. I have seen many minor (up to a separated shoulder, my own, requiring 4 weeks off) climbing injuries. Aspire to sport lead 12b/c, trad lead 11c/d G, and to get some FA's at nearby areas you haven't heard of and bolt some muti-pitch routes there. Yes, that means multi-pitch sport, probably in the 5.8-5.10 range. Multi-pitch sport in VA. If that doesn't give you goosebumps, you're not a climber.</td>

Aspire to the full Gauley next year (0x paddling, 2x rafting). Took an intro swiftwater rescue course, no certifications. Would be comfortable leading basic trips (upper James). Ref: Emily Powell, Pete Leavesley, Chance Lacey, Dave Clark. Comfortable on 3+ read & run, 4+ if scoped, 5 with beta.</td>

    <td>Caving experience</td>
    <td>Hamilton Cave, 1x. Hamilton Cave, past The Airblower, 2x. Crossroads Cave through Small Mans Shortcut, 1x. The cave near Snowshoe (I forget the name), 1x. Am a member of the NSS though I have yet to attend a meeting. Have NOT completed a cave rescue course and am NOT comfortable leading a bunch of un-trusted newbies into ANY cave no matter HOW basic, based on my experience. Have set up basic rope/webbing assist systems in caves and escorted people out for claustrophobia. I have a healthy respect for the consequences of actions in caves and would NOT lead a trip of un-trusted newbies unless I had completed a cave rescue course, had acquired the certification, and was on the short list of cave rescue assist personnel in the mid-Atlantic region. Ref: Matt Rosefsky, Kevin Kersten. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>Have been skiing since I was 7 years old. I could work on my powder skiing and vertical drops, but other than that I'm pretty solid. Aspire to pull off a helicopter. Have skied the continental US, Canada, and Europe. Favorite east coast resort: Jay Peak. Ref: Sergei Egorov, Matt Rosefsky, Kevin Kersten, Peter Thompson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>Am waiting for a chance to lead a trip to Franklin Traildaze so we can gain some credibility with Mike Gray (Grey?), aka The Troll of Franklin, aka the one taking down popular routes there, aka the one who almost single handedly maintains all of the trails and routes at Franklin, aka the one who finished the new bouldering wall at Rocky Top for free.

I also run, nowadays just to keep my endurance up for climbing. Have done the Cville Ten Miler 4x, Cville Half Marathon 1x, Richmond Ukrops 10k 1x, some other 10k's, other ten milers, lots of other races.

I was a lifeguard in high school and claim 2 rescues. My CPR and First Aid certifications are not current.

I would be interested in certifications &/or courses in (but not limited to) CPR, First Aid, WFA, WFR, Cave Rescue, Climbing Rescue, Swiftwater Rescue.

I have also been skydiving and scuba diving. I am certified in neither.

I will not cave dive. 

I would love to BASE jump and/or bungee jump.</td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I could lend a reasonable ear to decisions and possibly help avoid knee-jerk reactions to situations that come up. I tend to be safety minded in outdoor activities, especially when people other than myself are involved, and even more especially in caving where the consequences of even mild injuries are dire. I have a bit of experience climbing, sailing, and skiing and could offer educated opinions on all three. I could offer mildly educated opinions on kayaking, caving, hiking, backpacking, camping, etc.

I also tend to be pretty good at weighing opinions on situations and coming to a fair, amicable decision while considering the safety of others, and recognizing that the safety of others may render the decision unfair and non-amicable. Ref: Judy Thompson.

As for my trustworthiness and steady-headedness in stressful situations. Ref: Katrina Salmons, Chance Lacey, Jen Chang.
