    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>This is my most experienced field, and the one in which I feel most comfortable. Weekend backpacking trips (three so far) have been my favorite "adventures" this year; I feel that any excuse to get out in the woods is a good excuse! In high school I did an Outward Bound course in North Carolina, and went on a snowshoeing/backpacking trip in the Adirondacks. This year I've been on 2 2-night trips, and 1 3-night trip, and multiple day hikes. </td>

    <td>yayyyyy snowboarding! I love snowboarding. I started when I was in seventh grade, and after a 2 year hiatus during high school, I am back in the game with a new board :) I am also a big fan of snowshoeing. I went on a week-long trip in the Adirondacks last March where we snowshoed mostly, did some ice climbing, and used crampons. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>In high school, I organized river and trail cleanups for the Environmental Club, and this year I've been to one trail cleanup through the outdoors club at Walnut Creek. I am also the Conservation Advocate, a.k.a. recycling guru, for my dorm (Humphreys).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I love this club! It's probably my top reason for having a blast at UVA my first year. The people are awesome, the trips are great, and I would love to give back to the club aside from attending and leading trips by helping out w/ gear, club logistics, and funds, and generally contributing enthusiasm to the club, helping to maintain the tradition of "doing it outside." </td>
