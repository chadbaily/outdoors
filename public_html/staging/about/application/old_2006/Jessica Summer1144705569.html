    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I am a hall representative in House Council, First Year Representative in the Nursing Student Council, and was elected Secretary in the NSC for next year.

    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I've been paddling on the ocean, but only in very calm water.  I took a roll class this spring and got the Eskimo roll once, and I'm planning on taking more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>I've done tons of hiking and backpacking, ever since I was very young.  Every Saturday when I am home, I hike a mountain with my father, which takes four hours in the summer and up to 10 in the winter. I hiked the Chilkoot Trail twice (33-mile, four-day hike between Canada and Alaska used in the Klondike Gold Rush), have done many multiple-night backpacking trips, several in the winter.</td>

    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I was on my school's cross-country ski team for three years, so I have a very good handle on that.  I've only been downhill skiing three times and snowboarding twice, but I plan on getting a Wintergreen pass next year and learning to ski.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I have commercial fished every summer for 6 years. I have quite a bit of experience with mountaineering, using crampons and snowshoes, etc.  Over Christmas 2007, I am climbing Mount Aspiring in New Zeland with a group of cancer survivors to raise money for children's cancer camps.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I looooove Outdoors at UVA and am definitely going to start leading trips next year.  I really want to be even more involved - I've been on 13 trips so far this year.  I know leading trips is the next step in getting more invloved, and the ultimate is being an officer.</td>
