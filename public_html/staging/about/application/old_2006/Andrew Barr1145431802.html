I've also been skydiving.</td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I didn't become involved with the club until last summer. Due to this, I understand if I'm considered to be not involved enough to be an officer. All I can say is that I will be. I've probably been kayaking in the club boats at least 20 times in the last year, but not until the last couple weeks or so have I started to lead trips or really even join the ones I've attended online. I'm sorry I haven't. I just think its great that this is available and I want to be able to give back and help more people use what the Outdoors Club has to offer. So, either way I'll continue to lead trips and recruit new members from now on, but I want to be able to do more.  I haven't involved myself with very many things at the University bc I didn't enjoy them or see the value in them. I think the Outdoors Club does both for me. I both enjoy it and think it is very important to introduce others to the outdoors. I've spent the last two years twisting my friends arms in order to go camping, kayaking, rafting, or skiing. Now, I want to show other people how great the outdoors can be. I want to give back to what has made my experience at UVA that much better this year. Basically, I'm really thankful that this club exists and I want to help keep it as amazing as it is now, whatever I can do to help. </td>
