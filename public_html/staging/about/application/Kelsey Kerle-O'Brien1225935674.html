    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>Last year, I attended a week long service trip with Alternative Spring Break. We camped in Joshua Tree National Park and performed service work throughout the desert. I plan to continue to attend environmental trips over both Spring and Winter breaks with ASB for the next three years. 

Through my active role on the sailing team, I will be able to create sailing trips for club members. Each Saturday we drive out to Lake Anna, and spent a majority of the day out on the water. 

 I am also a member of VASST at UVA, so at least once a week in the winter season, I head out to Wintergreen to ski. 

In high school, I help found the "Envirothon" team, which traveled to marinas and nature reserves to compete in water sampling, track and pelt identification, and forestry identification. 

With the Science Club, I traveled to the Bahamas to spend a week surveying island biodiversity on Andros Island, snorkeling, and hiking. We frequently traveled to Cumberland Island, GA to camp. 
 
Through "Help the Hooch," a community service organization, I helped organize river cleanups twice a semester of a mile long stretch of the Chattahoochee River. 

As a science major at the Georgia Governor's Honors Program, I spent six weeks canoeing in the Valdosta marshlands, and hiking through the neighboring forest for our experiments.

    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I am currently on the ballot for the fall elections of Sailing Team. Last year I served as a Junior inter-sorority council representative. 

In High School, I was president of both the Science Club and the Science Olympiad Team. I was also a Student Council class representative, convention chair of Beta Club, and secretary of Junior Civitan. </td>

    <td>Climbing experience</td>
    <td>I first learned to climb last year, but with each seminar led by the club, I have become more confident and adept at climbing. By the end of this year, I hope to be climbing 5.9's or 5.10's. </td>

    <td>Kayaking experience</td>
    <td>I would like to practice the roll more before I would paddle Class 3 rapids, but after attending an Eastern Shore Kayaking trip through Outdoor Rec, I received detailed instruction in water rescues, and I grew strong in open water paddling.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hiking/Backpacking experience</td>
    <td>I attended hikes almost bi-monthly last year through the club. I have learned much of the lay of the Shenandoah Valley, and have grown confident reading maps (I also have begun to bring my GPS with me as a back-up safety device). As an officer, I would like to type up comprehensive lists which we could give to members, advising them on what to pack for a standard hiking or backpacking trip, emphasizing proper nutrition and layering for the longer time periods.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Snowsports experience</td>
    <td>I am an intermediate skier and have been practicing the sport infrequently since I was about 9 or 10 years old. I recently purchased new gear and would feel comfortable giving new members advice for shopping for skis, or providing beginner tutorials to members who would like to learn. I have enough knowledge of the lay of Wintergreen, to take a group on a variety of slopes and lifts. Last year I led a successful trip to do just this. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Other experience</td>
    <td>I received an award through the local newspaper in Columbus GA senior year of high school for my Community Service work. I specialized in environmental service. I frequently planned and implemented environmental service trips in high school, and would like to move the club in a direction where we would work at Rivanna, or at other local parks or rivers.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I frequently hear and think of ways in which the Outdoors Club can be expanded or improved. I hope to fill niches in the club that are not being currently explored, so I would constantly seek to ask members what trips they would like to see led. For example, few environmental service, horseback riding, or sailing trips were led in the past year. I have plans to lead all three of these trips within the semester. 

I would also like to create more opportunities for members of the club to interact. I felt like last year it was difficult to meet members of the club who favored different types of outdoor activities. I strongly believe that we should have regular outdoor movie nights, Potlucks, and spring trips to Blue Hole to hike and swim. 

I would like to advise younger members, not just on how to lead trips, but also on what sizes and brands of gear will suit them best, where they should travel, or even what outdoors magazines are best to subscribe to (Backpacker is my love). I am vivacious and friendly, so new members would find me approachable. I am ridiculously organized, often to the point of being referred to as OCD.

 I would like to be an officer because I want to have opportunities to share my love of the outdoors with others, helping them to become just as passionate about it as I am. I have helped at least five people register this semester, and hearing their stories from the great times they had hiking or backpacking was extremely rewarding. Ever since a hike last year in which my group became lost in the woods, and our leader followed an old hunting path to find the top of the mountain, I have been inspired to find new ways to interpret maps and to explore off the beaten path. Last year Brian Tai taught me that I was a better skier than I realized by literally pushing me down a black diamond in five foot visibility. He as a leader showed me how to find my own strength. At the kayaking roll workshop last year, I was trapped under kayak for two minutes, and terrified out of my mind, but the officer convinced me that I had nothing to fear, and talked me into immediately trying again. After that, I had the confidence to travel on a three day kayaking trip to the Eastern Shore. I want to be the person who refuses to loosen the top rope until someone has the confidence to climb to the top of the wall (this has also happened to me: I was left dangling fifty feet into the air, until I agreed, yes, I actually can finish this course). I want to teach them to push their limits and have faith in themselves, while at the same time teaching them to appreciate the beauty of the outdoors.
