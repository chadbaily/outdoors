    <td>Outdoors club(s) experience</td>
    <td>I've been backpacking, rock climbing, and hiking since the summer after 6th grade through a wilderness program in Colorado. When I was 15, I did a 30 day continuous backpacking trip through the Zirkel Wilderness in Colorado through the same program, and the next year did the program's 8 week outdoor leadership training program when I was 16. I began to work for them 3 summers ago when I was 18 years old as a trip leader.
I also did an outdoor-oriented environmental service learning program in the Galapagos Islands the summer before my senior year of high school, and have been a member of the UVa outdoors club since my 1st year.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Leadership experience</td>
    <td>I have worked the past three summers in Colorado as a trip leader, advancing each year with the age of the kids and the difficulty of the programs lead. The summer of 2007 I got my Wilderness First Responder Certification, and have been a lifeguard for the last five years. This past summer (2008), I lead the very same 30 day continuous backpacking trip that I did when I was 15. While also doing rafting, climbing, and caving, we hiked an estimated 250 miles, and taught the kids to be proficient enough at orienteering, backcountry cooking, weather judgment, ice-axing, and group dynamics to do the last week with their staff two miles behind them and sleeping at a different campsite. 
I also lead hikes for the UVa Outdoor Recreation Center several Sundays each semester. </td>

    <td>Why do you want to be an officer?</td>
    <td>I would really like to be an Outdoors Club Officer to be around like-minded people who share my same fervor for the Outdoors. I would also like to do it so that I could lead more backpacking trips for the club, and to raise interest in the sport. Also, I really appreciate all that the club has introduced me to since I came to UVa, and know that the club is the best avenue on grounds for students to experience the wilderness areas around Charlottesville, and would love to further facilitate that. I think I could add my experience and knowledge of gear, extended outdoor experiences, and wilderness medicine to the club. The only way I can see the club being improved now would maybe be more small scale and shorter trips to raise interest. I think more stove workshops, belay courses on the lawn, backcountry cooking, fire-building, and shelter constructing courses could be beneficial to those wanting to branch off on their own trips when UVa is not in session. </td>
