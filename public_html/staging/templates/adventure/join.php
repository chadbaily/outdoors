{SUCCESS:}
<p>You have successfully joined this adventure.</p>

<p class="notice"><b>If you cannot attend</b>, you need to withdraw.  If you
don't, we will mark you as absent, which makes you much less likely to be
admitted to future adventures.  Remember, if you don't attend, you have
prevented someone else from going!  <b>To withdraw, use the website so someone
else can be removed from the waitlist automatically.  Do not just contact the
leader.</b></p>

{:SUCCESS}

{WAITLIST:}

<p>You have successfully joined the waitlist for this adventure.  You will be
automatically removed from the waitlist and added to the adventure if someone
else withdraws and you are at the top of the waitlist.  If this happens, you
will get an email letting you know about it.</p>

<p class="notice">By remaining on the waitlist, <b>you are committing</b> to
attending this adventure in case you get off the waitlist.  If you change your
mind and don't want to attend, <b>you must withdraw from the adventure.</b>  Do
this online, not by contacting the adventure leader.  We don't want to save you
a spot if you're not going to use it, because someone else wants to go if you
don't.  And, remember if you don't attend, we will mark you as a no-show and
you'll be less likely to get accepted to future adventures.</p>
