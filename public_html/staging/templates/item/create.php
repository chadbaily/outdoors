<h1>Create a New Item</h1>

<p>Use this form to create a new item.  Another (possibly better) way to do this
is to find an existing item that's the same category and type as your item, and
matches it as closely as possible as far as features, purchase date, etc.
Then use the "copy" action on that item, and edit the resulting copy's
features as needed.</p>

<p><b>Please note</b> that the quantity field below should not be used to
indicate when we get another item.  We need to track items individually, and
create new items for each item when we get new ones or lose old ones.  Use the
quantity field only when the item is not trackable individually, as in the case
of AA batteries or similar.</p>
