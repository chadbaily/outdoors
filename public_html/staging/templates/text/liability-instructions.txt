Please verify that all information on the first page is correct. If there are any errors, please email outdoors-webmaster@virginia.edu and describe the problem. If all of the information is correct, please print this form and send the first page to Outdoors at UVa, P.O. Box 400444, Charlottesville, VA 22904 or drop it by the post office in Newcomb Hall, box 400444. Please be sure to include your membership dues as shown below (check made out to Outdoors at UVa, or cash (Outdoors at UVa is not responsible if it gets lost)).

<b>NOTE</b> We encourage you to use regular postal mail, not messenger mail.  Messenger mail sometimes takes weeks to get to us.

The <b>fastest and easiest</b> way to get your dues and waiver to us is to take it to the Newcomb Hall post office and hand it across the desk (no postage needed; they will place it directly into our mailbox).  This saves us all time and effort.  If absolutely necessary, you may also deliver your dues and waiver to an officer in person (only if necessary; we are very busy).  Contact the officers at outdoors-officers@virginia.edu if you must meet an officer.

Once we have received your dues, we will activate your membership and send you an email welcoming you to the club.
