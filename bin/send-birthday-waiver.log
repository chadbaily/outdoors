According to our records, you are currently a minor, but will soon turn 18. Given this, you will need to sign an indemnification AFTER you have turned 18. Please turn in your signed indemnification within 7 days of turning 18. You may sign the indemnification agreement electronically at https://www.hellosign.com/s/c101b9bb or you may print out a copy (available at http://www.outdoorsatuva.org/pub-files/OUVA_Liability_Waiver.pdf), sign it, and return it to the officers

Please email the officers if you have any questions!

Thanks,
The Officers
