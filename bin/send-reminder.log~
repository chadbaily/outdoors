To renew your membership, just login to the website (http://www.outdoorsatuva.org) and click renew at the top of the member's home page. You'll be able to pick from a 12-month membership for $30 and a 5-month one for $20. Just follow the instructions for dropping off or mailing your dues and a new waiver.  Again this year, you'll get your dues back if you lead 4 or more club trips.  Really active members also have the chance to become club officers.

Remember that as a member, you can borrow club gear, sign up for trips, and receive discounts from local merchants. On all official trips, the club will again cover gas and lodging costs. For overnight trips, the club will pay for most food expenses.
 
Please email the officers if you have any questions!

Thanks,
The Officers
