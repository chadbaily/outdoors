Dear Rebecca 
 

You have overdue gear! Please return the gear as soon as possible. If
you cannot make the regular gear rooms (or there are none, as is the
case during winter and summer breaks), please email the
officers (outdoors-officers@virginia.edu). As per club policy, you
will not be allowed to attend any club adventures until the overdue
gear is returned.

If you believe any of the
gear to be checked in, please respond to the officers with those item
numbers and any other information that may help us track that gear
down. As a reminder, it is your responsibility to ensure the gear
is returned. If gear has not been returned within 30 days, we will ask
that you pay for the replacement cost of the gear 
(http://www.outdoorsatuva.org/resources/?CheckingOutGear)

For Spring 2014, the regularly scheduled gear rooms are:
Tuesdays at 6:30pm and
Firdays at 2:00pm

As always, watch for the emails within a given week to ensure that
a gear room is indeed being held.

The gear you have out has been overdue for  days.


Happy Trails,
The Officers
