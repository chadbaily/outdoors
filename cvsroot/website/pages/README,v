@Most of these pages basically handle all actions that it is possible to take on
a given database object.  For example, 'account.php' handles everything it is
possible to do with an account.  However, the code for each action is kept
separately, in /pages/account.

Some pages include another file to handle an action based on the action's ID
number, such as 1, which translates to 'read' so you should look in the
appropriate subdirectory for a file named 'read.php' that handles the action.
Other pages are more general, such as 'join.php' which will not try to translate
an action code into an action name, but will just try to directly include the
file with the same name as the 'action' parameter in the URL.

These files are all included from ../index.php as determined by the 'page'
parameter in the URL.

There is an exception to this subdirectory structure.  Files in common/ are often
used by all sorts of different files.

Please read & understand common/include-file.php to understand more about how
these files are included and what they do with the content they generate.
