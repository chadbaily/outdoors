<h1>Becoming an officer</h1>

<p>The current officers are always seeking new officers to join their ranks.  In
order to become an officer, a member must lead at least 3 trips in a year and
must be approved by all current officers.  The single most important aspect that
we look for in new officers is a passion for the Club.</p>

<p>A few of our most active officers graduated this year, so we are looking for
replacements!  Contact us if you think you can contribute to the club.</p>

<h2>Officer Benefits</h2>

<p>Becoming an officer of Outdoors at UVA will give you experience running a
large club, which is a surprising amount of work.  As an officer, you can choose
to help out in any way you see fit: by leading trips, helping keep finances straight,
and so on.</p>

<p>If you are at all interested in becoming an officer, please let the officers
know!  Just shoot us an e-mail at
<script>document.write(email('outdoors-officers', 'virginia.edu'));</script>.</p>

<p>Becoming an officer of Outdoors at UVA will give you an immense amount of experience running a large club.  There is a surprising amount of work that goes into keeping the club running (we have over 300 members), and as an officer you will have the opportunity to keep this awesome club running.  As an officer, you can choose to help out in any way you see fit: by leading trips, helping out administratively, or helping with finances.</p>
