<h1>Leading a Club Adventure</h1>

<p>Outdoors at UVA is unique in that all the adventures are led by members.  The club
could not function without members who are willing to donate their time and
expertise to helping other members enjoy the outdoors.  The officers are always
looking for new leaders.</p>

<p>There are no prerequisites for leading most adventures.  You simply need to have
an interest in what you are doing, and be willing to share what you know with
others in the club.  If you would like to get your feet wet but you are
hesitant, we suggest leading an easy adventure first.  These types of adventures
include:</p>

<ul>

 <li><b>Horseback Riding</b> &mdash; We've already picked the stable, all you need to
 do is call them and reserve a date!</li>

 <li><b>Hiking</b> &mdash; Charlottesville has some beautiful mountains within 30
 minutes that are perfect for a day hike.  All you need to do is think of a
 place to go!  Check out past hikes for inspiration.</li>

 <li><b>Snow Tubing</b> &mdash; Wintergreen has some great snow tubing.  Simply get
 people together and go!</li>

 <li><b>And others...</b></li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, we encourage you to lead whatever outdoorsy adventures that you want to
lead.  We are always looking for new leaders to take people backpacking,
kayaking, or climbing.  Remember, the officers are here to help, so please
e-mail them at <script>document.write(email('outdoors-officers',
'virginia.edu'));</script> with your questions.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Adventure Online</h2>

<p>If you would like to lead a Club adventure, you must use the website to create the
adventure online.  If you are a first-timer, you must e-mail the officers at
<script>document.write(email('outdoors-officers', 'virginia.edu'));</script> in
order to get leader privileges on the website.  We'll give you those
privileges, and from that point on, setting up an adventure is a matter of
following the instructions in the <a
href="members/resources/leaders-manual">leader's manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Climbing and Caving Adventures</h2>

<p>There are special rules for <a
href="members/resources/climbing-permissions">climbing</a> and
<a href="members/resources/trip-cave">caving</a> adventures.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Trip Online</h2>

<p>Outdoors at UVA is run almost completely online.  If you would like to lead a
Club trip, you must use the website to create the trip online.  If you are a
first-timer, you must e-mail the officers at
d44 4
a47 23
order to get trip leader privileges on the website.  Once you have privileges,
you will see some new links, and setting up a trip is as simple as following the
directions from that point.  Please e-mail the officers with your questions
about what to say in the description, fees, etc etc.</p>

<h2>Trip Finances</h2>

<p>During the school year, Outdoors at UVA will pay for all the gas, lodging,
and food on a Club trip.  The club operates on a reimbursal system &mdash; so
whatever you buy for a trip, keep the receipts to get reimbursed.  The club will
pay the following for meals:</p>

<ul>
 <li>$2/person for breakfast</li>
 <li>$4/person for lunch </li>
 <li>$6/person for dinner </li>
</ul>

<p>If a member spends more than this on a meal, then the member needs to pay for
the difference.  In order to get reimbursed for gas, you must print off a gas
receipt form and have all drivers sign the form when you give them money for
gas.  Once the trip is over, you can turn in any receipts for food and lodging,
along with the gas receipt form, to an officer to receive reimbursement.</p>
