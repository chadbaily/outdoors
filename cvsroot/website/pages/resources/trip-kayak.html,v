         <li>First-aid supplies</li>

        </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Possible Gear</h2>

<p>Possible gear that can be used for a kayaking trip include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Five all-around whitewater kayaks and one sit-on-top kayak</li>
 <li>Spray jackets</li>
 <li>PFDs</li>
 <li>Paddles</li>
 <li>Helmets</li>

 <li>PFDs</li>
 <li>Helmets</li>
 <li>Paddles</li>

<p><b>Any sort of watersports gear can be checked out by any club member.  However, all gear is restricted to use on flat water, unless cleared by one of the watersports officers.</b></p>

<h2>Rating System</h2>

<p>The club's rating system for paddling experience is as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Beginner</b> – Someone who has completed the introductory course or has similar experience. This person has been in a white water kayak and knows the basics strokes, recovery techniques, and how to wet exit. More experienced beginners have river experience. They’ve paddled through class 1-3 rapids with guidance.</li>
 <li><b>Intermediate</b> – An intermediate paddler has ample experience in white water. He/she has paddled at least class 3 rapids numerous times, knows how to ferry and eddy turn well, and can Eskimo roll in flat water. The intermediate paddler doesn’t necessarily have a bomb proof roll.</li>
 <li><b>Advanced</b> – If you are an advanced paddler you’ve kayaked through at least class 4 rapids, have a solid roll, and know well such terms as “boof”, “keeper”, and “chundering hole”. You can easily read class 3 rivers and you have enough river experience to have participated in some form of river rescue. You are likely qualified to lead a group down your top 3 most run sections at various levels.</li>
 <li><b>Expert</b> – If you are an expert paddler, you are not reading this checklist! Your river reading skills are top notch. You could paddle some of the hardest stuff out there with complete confidence. You are up to date on paddle techniques and river rescue. You are a god on the river!</li>
</ul>
