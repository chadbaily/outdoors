<h1>Leader's Manual</h1>

<p>Please e-mail the officers to make sure that the adventure you want to lead
is feasible, gear will be available, and there aren&rsquo;t any conflicts.
Please do not post an adventure without first consulting the officers, since we
do not want, for example, 5 kayaking adventures to go out at the same time, or
an adventure that may not be in keeping with the club's mission.  The officer's
e-mail list is <A
HREF="mailto:outdoors-officers@@virginia.edu">outdoors-officers@@virginia.edu</A>.</p>

<p>There are special rules for <a
href="members/resources/climbing-permissions">climbing</a> and
<a href="members/resources/trip-cave">caving</a> adventures, so
be sure to read them before creating one.</p>

<h1>1 Equipment</h1>

<p>Before you create your adventure, email the officers with a list of the
equipment you think you will need so that we can make sure we own that gear, and
that it isn&rsquo;t already reserved for another adventure. If we don&rsquo;t
own the gear, or don&rsquo;t have enough for your adventure, we still might  be
able to work something out, so email us with your adventure idea anyway.</p>

<h2>1.1 Obtaining Gear</h2>


<p>To obtain gear, you must e-mail the officers at least several days in advance
(<A
HREF="mailto:outdoors-officers@@virginia.edu">outdoors-officers@@virginia.edu</A>)
to set up a time for them to open the gear room for you. If members will be
borrowing gear, it is better that they do it with you, so that we can do it all
at once. Be sure to let the members know when you will be getting gear. If they
are not available when you go to get gear, then you can tell them to contact the
officers.</p>

<h2>1.2 Returning Gear</h2>

<p>You must also set up a return time with the officers.  You must return the
gear within a week.</p>

<p class="notice">Please, do not go to the gear room without an officer.  Do not
leave gear outside for an officer to pick up (if it's stolen, you're still
responsible for it).  And if you arrive at the gear room and the officer
isn't outside to meet you, do not try to get inside.  Any of these things could
get us into trouble with the Housing Division, which has been a serious problem
in the past.</p>

<h1>2 Setting up the Adventure Online</h1>

<p>You should already have leader capabilities, however, if you cannot find the
link to create an adventure or need any other help, e-mail the officers.</p>

<p>To start, sign in to the website, click on &ldquo;Adventures&rdquo; at left,
and you should see a &ldquo;Create an adventure&rdquo; link.  Follow this link
and fill out all of the information on the page, following the directions
below.</p>

<h2>2.1 Details</h2>

<p>Your details should include:</p>

<UL>

    <LI><B>Specific details on the adventure</B> &mdash; make it interesting and
    mention if it&rsquo;s only for beginners or experts and what you&rsquo;re
    going to be doing.  This is your sales pitch, so try not to make it
    boring.</li>

    <LI><B>What the participant must bring</B> &mdash; this is usually clothes
    or any personal gear.  Also, include any extra money that people need to
    bring (like lunch or something).</li>

    <LI><B>What Outdoors at UVA provides &mdash;</B> this is usually tents,
    sleeping bags, etc.  You&rsquo;ve already emailed the officers about
    requesting gear, so you know what we can provide.</li>

    <LI><B>Related Links &mdash;</B> If you have a link that is useful for
    people to see, copy and paste it into the adventure description.</li>

</UL>

<p>Please also select the types of activities that your adventure falls into.
This does a lot of things behind the scenes for us.</p>

<h2>2.2 Questions</h2>

<p>After completing the details section, you will go to the &ldquo;Edit
Questions&rdquo; page.  The  most common questions (for this type of adventure)
appear.  You can copy these into your adventure, or add your own.  To add your
own, fill out the question in the appropriate box, select whether it is a
true/false question or just a free response one, and then hit &ldquo;Create
Question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ask any relevant questions here.  These may include whether the members need
a sleeping bag/pad, whether they have a tent and how many it sleeps, and whether
they need any other gear.  Also, you should ask any questions that are
prerequisites for the adventure, such as &ldquo;what rivers have you
paddled&rdquo; or &ldquo;what level climbing routes can you do (5.xx).&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t forget to ask if anyone can drive (it should be in the most common
questions section).</p>

<p class="notice">Every adventure should include the question, &ldquo;<B>Please
note all medical conditions (this is confidential)</b>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>2.3 Joining</h2>

<p>You must join the adventure to activate it.  Click on join, fill out the
questions and join the adventure yourself.  You cannot withdraw from your own
adventure, since you are the leader.</p>

<h2>2.4 Activating</h2>

<p>Once you are satisfied with the adventure, email the officers so that we can
take a quick look and make sure everything is good. When the officers have
approved go ahead and activate it by clicking on the &ldquo;Activate&rdquo; tab.
This will make the adventure visible to everyone who looks on the website.</p>

<h2>2.5 Announcing</h2>

<p>Look over your adventure description and questions before announcing it.  To
see your description as others will see it, click on &ldquo;Details&rdquo;.
Once you are satisfied, click on &ldquo;Announce&rdquo; and announce the
adventure.  This will send an email to the members.  You are now done creating
your adventure!</p>

<h2>2.6 Viewing the Adventure Report</h2>

<p>Once people have started signing up, you will want to check people&rsquo;s
responses to questions and see who is signed up.  To do this, sign in to the
website, go to &ldquo;Adventures I am leading&rdquo; and click on View Report.
The report shows you all the information you need to know about the attendees,
and gives you radio buttons to manage the waitlist, etc etc.</p>

<p>You can also use this page to mark someone absent if they don't show up
later.  Please contact any absent attendees first and ask them about why they
didn't show up, then mark them absent and make a note of why.  This can help
future leaders avoid deadbeats.</p>

<h2>2.7 Other</h2>

<p>You can use the tabs at the top of the adventure details page to do other
tasks such as emailing the attendees, but if you need to do something that's not
shown in the tabs, look in the drop-down box on the &ldquo;Details&rdquo; page
and see what's available.  For example, you can deactivate an adventure to hide
it from the members, if you decide you activated it too soon.</p>

<h1>3 Expenses</h1>

<p>The leader pays for all expenses at first, and the club will reimburse the
leader upon completion of the adventure.  To be reimbursed, you must fill out an
<a href="members/expense_report">expense report</a>, gather ALL
receipts and then email the officers email list to coordinate meeting the
treasurer to get reimbursed.  You must have the expense report filled out, all
gas forms filled out, and all receipts with you in order to get reimbursed (the
most important receipts are the lodging receipts, so please don&rsquo;t
lose these!).</p>

<h2>3.1 Food</h2>

<p>During the school year, Outdoors at UVA will pay for all the gas, lodging,
and food on a Club adventure.  The club will pay the following for meals:</p>

<ul>
 <li>$2/person for breakfast</li>
 <li>$4/person for lunch </li>
 <li>$6/person for dinner </li>
</ul>

<p>Please check the <a href="members/decision">officer policies page</a>
for more details on what we will pay for.</p>

<h2>3.2 Participation Fees</h2>

<p>The participation fee is made up of fees the club does not pay. You won't
have extra fees on most adventures, but sometimes an adventure will have some
other costs associated with it such as an activities fee or equipment rental
(skydiving, for example); contact the officers to find out how you should handle
this.</p>

<h2>3.3 Lodging Fees</h2>

<p>The club will reimburse you for all lodging fees.  Since you want to be
reimbursed after the adventure, please hold on to the receipts and if they
don&rsquo;t give you one, ask them to make one.</p>

<h2>3.4 Gas</h2>

<p>You need to pay your drivers for gas, and then the club will reimburse you.
Follow the instructions on the 
<a href="/pub-files/GasReceiptFormc">Gas Receipt Form</a>.</p>
