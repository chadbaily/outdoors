<h1>Rock Climbing Checklist</h1>

<p><b>Rock climbing, although enjoyable, can be extremely dangerous.</b>  If you
are considering leading a climbing trip, please see our <a
href="members/resources/climbing-permissions">special rules</a> for
climbing trips.</p>

<h2>Attending an Official Club Climbing Trip</h2>

<p>You should consider these questions before going on a climbing trip:</p>

<ol>
 <li><b>Is this trip for me?</b></li><br>
   Club trips are usually divided to 3 main levels:<br><br>
   <i><b>Beginner</b></i><br>
     <ul>
      <li>You have never climbed.</li>
      <li>You have climbed a few times, but you have forgotten how things work.</li>
      <li>You know how to belay a top rope climber, but you climb less than <a href="http://www.climber.org/Resource/decimal.html#fifth">5.8</a></li>
     </ul>
   Being able to walk and use both your hands are the only physical requirements for this level.<br><br>
   <i><b>Intermediate:</b></i><br>
     <ul>
      <li>You know how to belay and tie in and you climb better than <a href="http://www.climber.org/Resource/decimal.html#fifth">5.8</a> on top rope.</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
   <i><b>Advanced:</b></i><br>
     <ul>
      <li>You know how to belay a leader, and you climb better than <a href="http://www.climber.org/Resource/decimal.html#fifth">5.9</a> on top rope.</li>
      <li>You sport climb.</li>
      <li>You trad climb.</li>
     </ul>
   <p>Higher level climbers may go to lower level trips.</p>
 <li><b>What about climbing equipment?</b></li><br>
   The club provides <b>all</b> climbing gear. However, if you wanted to buy your own gear, you would want to own the following (at least):<br>
     <ul>
      <li>Climbing shoes (highly recommended)</li>
      <li>Harness (required)</li>
      <li>Belaying device (required, but you can share this with 1-2 others)</li>
      <li>Chalk bag (optional)</li>
     </ul><br>
  <li><b>What other things do I need to bring?</b></li>
     <ul>
      <li>2-3 liters of water per day (required)</li>
      <li>Snacks like: energy bars, trail mix, fruit, dried fruit, jerky, and cookies (recommended)</li>
      <li>Camera (optional)</li>
     </ul><br>
  <li><b>What clothes should I wear?</b></li>
     <ul>
      <li>Long shorts or comfortable pants(highly recommended).</li>
      <li>Rain jacket (optional)</li>
      <li>Warm clothes for cold weather including hat and gloves (recommended)</li>
     </ul><br>
  <li><b>Anything else?</b></li><br>
    You may want to cut your toe and finger nails, not wear your watch or rings while climbing, wear a glasses leash, and bring sunscreen (all recommended).
</ol>

<h2>Going Climbing on Your Own</h2>

<p>If you are a beginner make sure to climb with experienced climbers. You can
always write to the <a href="members/main/email">club email list</a>
in order to find climbing partners. You can borrow shoes, harness, chalk bag and
belaying devices for free. Please write to
<script>document.write(email('outdoors-officers', 'virginia.edu'));</script> 3-4
days in advance to check for the availability and to set up a time to meet to
get gear.</p>

<p>You can borrow top rope, sport climbing or trad gear only if you have already
climbed with the climbing officer of the club and you have proved your ability
to use the gear properly and safely. Your name will be written in the authorized
people's list in the locker room.</p>

<p>Make sure to take:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Technical gear appropriate for the type of climbing and size of the group (Required)</li>
 <li>Guide book (highly recommended)</li>
 <li>First Aid (Highly recommended)</li>
 <li>Helmet (Highly recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leading an Outdoors at UVA Climbing Trip</h2>

<p>If you are an experienced climber we encourage you to lead trips.  Climbing
is one of our most popular activities. The club pays back your membership dues
if you have led 4 official trips. Also by leading a few trips you can become an
officer.  The club is always in need of officers, since people are always
graduating.</p>

<p>Because of the danger involved in climbing, we have <a
href="members/resources/climbing-permissions">special rules</a>
about who can lead climbing adventures.</p>

<h3>Indoor Trips</h3>

<p>Everybody can lead official INDOOR climbing trips, since it is at a climbing
gym where there is supervision, however, only <a
href="members/resources/climbing-permissions">qualified
leaders</a> can lead indoor trips for beginners. The club will pay for
transportation. Please write to the officers list to arrange the trip a week in
advance.</p>

<h3>Other Trips</h3>

<p>To lead other climbing trips you must have already climbed with one of the
climbing officer and proven your ability to lead a fun and safe trip.  The
officers will approve you to lead these trips when you have shown you are
ready.</p>


<h3>Sport Climbing Trips</h3>

<p>Just having sport climbed doesn't mean a person is experienced enough to lead
trips for the club.  Leading trips for a club is totally different from
going climbing with friends.  It is a huge responsibility.  In order to have a
safe trip the <b>sport climbing leader</b> must:</p>

<ul>

<li>know the leading skills perfectly including belaying, clipping,
falling and cleaning.</li>

<li>make sure that people who claim to know these skills actually <b>do</b> know
and do them the right way.  This is very important.  The leader must watch them
very closely, or even ask them to demonstrate before doing anything else.</li>

<li>teach the first time leaders the skills (especially falling, belaying, and
        cleaning anchor) in a correct and <b>safe</b> way. Just telling a
beginner how to do it is not enough to <b>guide</b> a group. The leader must
always expect that the beginner will do it the wrong way, and provide the right
back ups.</li>

<li>evaluate routes for beginner sport climbers (not just first timers --  also people who
        have sport climbed for under a  year or so) for safety, things like the first bolt,
        falling down past overhangs and ledges below.  The leader must not allow
        climbers to lead routes that are not appropriate for them.</li>

<li><b>not allow beginner sport climbers (definition above) to clean an anchor.</b></li>

</ul>
