<h1>Outdoors at UVa</h1>

<p><a href="javascript:imageWindow('waterfall.jpg')"><img src="images/waterfall-thumb.jpg" class="thumbnail-right" height="150" width="100" alt="A nearby
waterfall"></a>Outdoors at UVa is an exciting and fun outdoors club based
at the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, VA.
We are a student-run organization, so most (but not all) of our
members are <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>
students.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:imageWindow('bouldering.jpg')"><img src="images/bouldering-thumb.jpg" 
class="thumbnail-left"></a>

We have a large and active membership &mdash; over 400 members.  Members
participate in a huge variety of <a
href="index.php?page=activities">activities</a> all over Charlottesville,
surrounding areas and states, and even all over the US and world, at very
low cost.  Last year we led <a
href="members/main/past-adventures">over 150 trips</a>!
Outdoors at UVa has a talented and energetic corps of <a
href="index.php?page=officers">officers and leaders</a>, who plan outdoors
trips and manage the organization.  We have a large collection of
top-quality, well-maintained gear that members can borrow for free.  For
more information, read <a href="index.php?page=how-it-works">how the club
works</a>.</p>

<p>Membership is inexpensive and comes with a huge array of <a
href="index.php?page=how-it-works">benefits</a>.  If you're ready to hit the
trail, <a href="members/join">join the club</a>! If you need more
information, read our <a href="index.php?page=faq">frequently asked
questions</a> list; if you still have a question, you may <a
href="index.php?page=contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>And don't miss our <a href="index.php?page=schedule">upcoming meetings</a>,
where you can find out all about us while you enjoy beautiful photos of our
past trips.</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

<p>Our Mission Statement defines our purpose, values, and principles as an
organization.</p>

<blockquote style="border:1px solid #252; padding:1em">

environmental preservation, educating others about nature, and developing
leadership skills.
