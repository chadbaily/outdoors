<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<dl>

<dt>I missed the meeting.  Can I still join?</dt>

<dd>Yes, of course.  The meetings are just informational.  You can always <a
href="members/join">join online</a>.</p>

<dt>I'm busy and can't come to everything.  Is that okay?</dt>

<dd>Of course.  Attend whatever adventures you like.  There are no
obligations.</dd>

<dt>Can you tell me what activities you have planned?</dt>

<dd>Our adventures are led by members, most of whom are college students.  They
are typically planned from one to four weeks in advance.  You can get a feel for
what we do, and how often, by looking at our list of <a
href="members/main/past-adventures">past adventures</a>.
Otherwise, we can't tell you what we have planned; this is a member
privilege.</dd>

<dt>Can I come on one or two trips to see if I like it?</dt>

<dd>Our official policy is to keep our trips members-only.  We have busy
schedules and a lot of members to serve; we focus on the members, because
they've paid for the attention.  If you're interested in outdoors activities,
please join.  You won't regret it.  The number, variety, and quality of
activities we do is amazing, and the cost &mdash; check the <a
href="members/join">join page</a> &mdash; is ridiculously low,
especially considering that most trips are free.</dd>

<dt>How often do you do [activity]?</dt>

<dd>Please look at our list of <a
href="members/main/past-adventures">past adventures</a>.</dd>

<dt>Do you do (caving, hiking, scuba diving, whatever)?</dt>

<dd>Please look at our <a href="index.php?page=activities">activities</a> page,
and of course our list of <a
href="members/main/past-adventures">past adventures</a>.</dd>

<dt>Where do I hand in my dues?</dt>

<dd>There are instructions on the second page of your liability waiver.</dd>

<dt>Can I meet with an officer to hand in my dues and waiver?</dt>

<dd>If absolutely necessary, yes.  But remember we are trying to serve hundreds
of members.  Please, follow the instructions on the second page of your
liability waiver and put it in our mailbox &mdash; this will save us all a lot
of time. If you hand deliver it to our mailbox (as opposed to mailing it) you 
don't even need stamps and it gets to us in the same day.</dd>

<dt>I joined but I never got to go on any trips.  I want a refund.</dt>

<dd>Dues are non-refundable.  We don't guarantee that you will go on any trips,
because this is a member-run club.  Nobody is paid to ensure that you have a
good time.  If you want to get outdoors and do something, there are hundreds
of people to do it with, and the club will even lend you gear.</dt>

<dt>Can I still rent gear even if I'm not a member?</dt>

<dd>We do not <b>rent</b> gear to anyone.  Members may <b>borrow</b> some gear
under certain conditions.</dd>
