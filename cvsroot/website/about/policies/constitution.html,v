<p>Outdoors at UVa is a group of students and community members united
by their desire to enjoy outdoor activities with friends, while promoting
safety, preserving the outdoors for future enjoyment, educating others about
outdoor activities, and developing leadership skills.</p>

</td>

<p><b>Educating others about outdoor activities</b> originally read <b>educating
others about nature</b>, but we believe this was too broad.  Our focus is on
activities in the outdoors.  <b>Preserving the outdoors for future enjoyment</b>
originally read <b>promoting safety and environmental preservation</b>, but we
thought this had a tone of imposing an obligation on members.  We want to avoid
the sense that we think our members have an obligation, and instead encourage
our members to preserve while they enjoy.</p>

decisions that uphold the spirit of the Constitution.</p></td>

<tr>

<td>

<p>1. Outdoors at UVa has but one purpose, which along with a statement of our
values, is defined in our Mission Statement.</p>

</td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>We believe that a single purpose is vital to avoid dilution of our mission.
We have expanded our purpose in the past to include charity events, and feel
that this was an unsuccessful experiment.  It burdened the officers, caused a
club-wide debate, and in the end we believe did not benefit anyone.  Officers
did not always agree whether a given event was a charity, and if so, how much to
fund it.  This was a huge distraction from our primary focus on outdoors
activities.</p>

<p>There are a number of organizations that address other interests.  For
example, there are two service fraternities at UVa, there is Student
Environmental Action, and many local organizations such as TradeLocal.  We do
not wish to dilute our purpose by trying to bring elements of such other
missions into ours, however related the missions may be.  Instead, we try to do
one thing and do it well: have fun in the outdoors.</p>

</td>
#annotation -->

</tr>
<tr>

<td><p>2. Outdoors at UVa should be autonomous, except in matters affecting UVa
or the UVa Student Council as a whole.  As a Contracted Independent
Organization, we must work within the parameters established by the UVa Student
Council.  However, as a group, our group conscience is our sole
authority.</p></td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>The officers are entrusted to protect the best interests of the whole club.
No officer governs absolutely; the officers always try to reach consensus on
issues according to their group conscience.</p>

<p>We feel that not all club members are competent to make good decisions about
how the club is run.  We have tried taking issues to members for a vote before,
and we felt that the members were not informed enough, even though we tried to
prepare them.  Many of the issues can only be grasped by someone who has been an
officer for some time.</p>

</td>
#annotation -->

</tr>
<tr>

<td><p>3. We have no opinion on external issues, thus our name should never be
drawn into public controversy.  Other groups provide appropriate places for
people to be involved in such issues.</p></td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>We do not ignore external issues; we just do not want to take a stance on
them as an organization.  Members are free to take a stance as they wish.
Members are even free to lead adventures that express their opinions &mdash; for
example, attending a conference on environmental issues.  Members who want to
participate in such activities are free to do so.</p>

<p>We also recognize that as an organization, we have a vested interest in some
external issues such as cleanliness of the outdoors we want to enjoy.  We do
not, however, have a group opinion about specific issues.  Instead we encourage
our members to preserve the outdoors as they enjoy it responsibly, educate
themselves about issues, and be good citizens.  We leave it to the members to
take individual action to safeguard the group's interests.  Members may do this
within the club, for example by leading trips to clean up a river.  We also want
to distinguish between interests we have as a group &mdash; such as a clean
environment &mdash; and specific issues, which people may have opinions on.  We
want to stay away from opinions, because they are personal and there is no right
or wrong.</p>

<p>In the spirit of cooperation, we may approve email messages informing our
members what other organizations are doing, as long as it meets our usual email
list criteria: it must be primarily outdoorsy.  We need to be especially
vigilant about enforcing a no-politics policy.</p>

</td>
#annotation -->

</tr>
<tr>

<td><p>4. We should never lend our name to, assist, or endorse any other
enterprise, lest problems of money, property, or prestige distract us from our
mission.</p></td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>We do not, as a group, endorse any other entities or take a stance on what
they do.  However, we recognize that our members, as individuals, may be
interested in these other entities, and we encourage people to branch out.  This
is partially motivated by a desire for our members to safeguard our group
interests.  We want to foster a spirit of cooperation with other entities,
especially among UVa CI Os like ourselves, but we need to be careful not to
appear as though we are endorsing them.</p>

</td>
#annotation -->

</tr>
<tr>

<td><p>5. We should remain financially and materially independent, to avoid
becoming indebted or obligated to an external interest.</p></td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>We do not want to become part of a good-old-boys club where we scratch
someone's back and they scratch ours.  We want to avoid this in publicity,
financial, and other ways; for example, we don't want to rely on someone else's
equipment, especially in return for some service or other benefit (except for
individual trips, of course).  No quid pro quo!</p>

</td>
#annotation -->

</tr>
<tr>

<td><p>6. We may turn to professionals for assistance with matters outside our
expertise, but our officers should never be compensated for their position or
services.</p></td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>There are times when we will need help from a professional, such as a lawyer,
but as a group we should remain volunteers ourselves.</p>

<p>We distinguish between officers and those who lead trips; a person may do
both, but the roles should not be confused.  Professional experience can enhance
a person's ability to fulfill either role, and we welcome those with expertise.
However, we do not want anyone to view Outdoors at UVa as part of his or her
profession.  As officers, we receive no compensation for what we do.  Leaders
may be incited to lead adventures, but we want our organization to run on
contributions of time and talent from its members.</p>

</td>
#annotation -->

</tr>
<tr>

<td><p>7. Notwithstanding other Principles, we are part of a UVa and larger
community, and we do not wish to insulate ourselves unnecessarily.  We may
cooperate with other groups when it is appropriate and serves our mission.  We
accept support from UVa Student Council.  We also accept and arrange member and
group discounts from vendors and local businesses, when it is in accord with
these Principles.</p></td>

<!-- #annotation
<td class="annotation">

<p>We believe that obtaining discounts for members and as a group benefits our
group.  However, we need to be careful to keep our group interests in the
forefront, and not let ourselves be swayed by an offer that compromises any of
our Principles.</p>
