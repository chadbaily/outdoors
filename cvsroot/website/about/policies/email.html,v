<h1>Outdoors at UVa Email List Policy</h1>

<p>The main purpose of the outdoors-club list is for outdoor and club-related
email. If the email is in keeping with our
<a href="index.php?page=policies">mission statement</a>, and you feel that it is
something that 300 or more other members would benefit from reading, then go
ahead, send the email, and help build our outdoor community.  Please ask the
officers if you are in doubt.  We are not super-strict, but we do want to keep
our club focused on the things mentioned in our mission statement.  Here are
some rough guidelines:</p>

<p>Appropriate emails include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anything involving the outdoors</li>
  <li>notices about outdoorsy presentations</li>
  <li>information about Skyline Drive, the Blue Ridge Parkway, conditions of
    local rivers and hikes, etc.</li>
  <li>non club related trips (i.e. anyone want to join me on a hike to...)</li>
  <li>looking for climbing partners, running partners, someone to go on a
    spur-of-the-moment hike or other activity</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.  All of these items build our community
and are related to our mission.  Inappropriate emails are those which are
not outdoorsy and not related to our mission, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>looking for a ride home</li>
  <li>advertising anything for sale</li>
  <li>commentary on outside issues such as politics or world events</li>
  <li>elections or endorsements</li>
  <li>porn, jokes, chain letters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Email Writing Guidelines</h2>

<p>Please keep your email <b>short and to the point</b>.  If you need to make it
long, it's probably better to just mention the main point of the email in one
or two sentences, and then give your name and contact information so people can
get in touch with you directly to find out more.  Please follow these
guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep it short.</li>
  <li>DO NOT SHOUT.  EVER.  THIS IS SHOUTING.</li>
  <li>Don't use lots of exclamation points, either!!!</li>
  <li>Create a relevant, short subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sample email:</p>

<blockquote style="border:1px solid gray; padding: 5px">
Subject:Climb at Rocky Top Thursday<br>
<br>
I'm going climbing at Rocky Top Thursday at 5:00 PM.  Contact Morgan Jones at
<script>document.write(email('morgan', 'jones.com))</script>, or 123-4567,
if you want to ride along.
</blockquote>

<p>If you're not sure about an email you want to send, please <a
href="index.php?page=contact">ask the officers</a>.</p>

<p>Please keep your email <b>short and to the point</b>.  You should be able to
say what you need in one or two sentences.  If you need to make it longer, it's

email. If the email is &quot;outdoorsy&quot; and you feel that it is something
that 300 or more other members would benefit from reading, then go ahead, send
the email, and help build our outdoor community.</p>

<p>What exactly constitutes an &quot;outdoorsy&quot; email is not set in stone.
If you follow common sense, then you'll probably be correct.  Here are some
rough guidelines:</p>

<p><b>Great</b> emails include:</p>
d23 2
a24 2
  <li>invitations to social events planned mostly for outdoors club members
   it (might be a good idea to clear the email with the officers first though)</li>
d27 1
a27 1
  spur-of-the-moment hike or other activity</li>
d30 3
a32 3
<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p><b>Unfavorable</b> emails are those which are not outdoorsy, such as:</p>
d42 1
a42 1
<p>If you're not sure about an email you want to send, feel free to ask us at
a44 3

<p>If someone sends an unfavorable email, we'll remind that person of these
guidelines and ask them not to do it again.</p>
