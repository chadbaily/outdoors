<h1>Outdoors at UVa Equipment Policy for Members</h1>

<p>Outdoors at UVa has a large inventory of gear for all the outdoors activities that we do.  As a club member, you will be able to check out gear for a week at no charge.  Available gear includes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Tents</li>
 <li>Sleeping Bags/Pads</li>
 <li>Backpacks</li>
 <li>Climbing Harnesses and Shoes</li>
 <li>Trad Rack, Quickdraws, and Dynamic Ropes</li>
 <li>Stoves</li>
 <li>Canoes</li>
 <li>Kayaks</li>
 <li>PFDs</li>
 <li>Mountain Bikes</li>
 <li>Caving Equipment</li>
 <li>(Old) Cross Country Skis</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few restrictions on gear check out.  These restrictions are:</p>

<ul>

 <li><b>You must not try to get gear yourself.</b>  If you go to the gear room
 yourself and try to get in, or even get in the building, the Club will suffer
 severe consequences.  We had problems in the past and very nearly lost our
 gear-room privileges.  If you need to get or return gear, you <b>must</b>
 coordinate it with the officers.</li>

 <li>Official club trips take precedence!  From time to time, a trip will need
 all the tents or sleeping bags.</li>

 <li>All gear must be returned in a week, or we will impose a $5 per week late
 fee.  If you would like to check out gear for a longer period, please ask the
 officers.</li>

 <li>Each member may check out <i>personal</i> gear for <b>one</b> non-member
 friend. (e.g. one member cannot check out multiple tents, because a tent is not
 personal gear)</li>

</ul>

<p>If you would like to check out gear, you must e-mail
<script>document.write(email('outdoors-officers', 'virginia.edu'))</script> and
set up a time to get into the gear room.  Please request gear as soon as you
know you need it &mdash; please don't wait till the last minute!</p>
