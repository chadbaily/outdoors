I have been in a relationship with the outdoors since first year, 
and I am completely in love.  Sure, sometimes the trail gets rocky 
or rainy, but that just makes the sun shine brighter, the water 
taste better, and the views more stunning.  I also seriously think 
that you could eat dining hall food around the campfire and it will 
taste like a gourmet meal. Oh – and s’mores (enough said)!! Other than 
backpacking and hiking, I also enjoy climbing and a good trail run 
because “seven days without running makes one weak”!  So let me know 
if you need a good place to backpack or just want to run around a bit!

  For the past several years I have had a difficult time 
  keeping myself out of the local backcountry.  Although I
love adventure in all of its many forms, hiking,
backpacking, and climbing compose my outdoor hubris.  Some
people derive contentment from the Bible and entrust their
faith in God. I have a backpack and boots- and seek
contentment from the mountains I climb- thanks to their
brilliant and shimmering beauty.  I dream of one day front
pointing the icy slopes of the Karakoram and the
Cordillera Blanca, and all of the other great ranges of
the world.  But, until then, I am eager to explore the
beautiful natural world that surrounds us here in C?ville.
Feel free to e-mail me if you ever have any questions
about leading backpacking or hiking trips- especially
those that are remote, uncharted, and dangerously foolish;
for these are my favorite kinds!

    I am compulsively, magnetically attracted to rock.  I love rock and it loves
    me.  When I was little I would beg my dad to take me bouldering, I would
    dream up places we'd never been.  And, now thanks to our fabulous Outdoors
    Club I can climb any time I want.  Currently I've been doing a lot of sport
    climbing, but hopefully soon I'll be getting into trad!  When I can&rsquo;t
    climb I might decide to camp in the woods, take a hike, clean up a highway,
    or just watch the stars.  And lastly, my love of rock is balanced by a crazy
    fear of the water.

   Hi!  I've been involved with the club since its revival a few years ago.  I'm
   now graduated, but I live in Charlottesville and have had such good times and
   met so many awesome people through the club that I stick around and plan to
   keep on doing it.  I work on the website a good bit, because I'm a programmer
   and it's so much fun to work on something that I'm not getting told to do!  I
   love hiking and running, camping and hiking, skiing and hiking, and just
   about everything else we do and hiking.  I also love just going out and looking at the
   stars or something.  I've been known to be hard-core but I don't need to in
   order to be happy.

   I've been an avid cyclist, backpacker, skier, and
whitewater enthusiast for many years; since coming to UVA
I've added climbing, high altitude mountaineering/glacier
travel, and skydiving to the list, while ice-climbing is a
hopeful prospect for the near future. I also pride myself
in being able to plow through a vermonster in record time.
Email me anytime if I can be of some help, or if you want
to do something crazy, I'm in.

      For 10 years before coming to UVa I was barely seen in towns on weekends.
      Moving around hot deserts to crevassed glaciers, boulders to big walls, 
      seaside to high altitude. My favorites are alpine climbing, high altitude
      mountaineering, aid climbing and recently skydiving. In 1999 I was 
      certified as a climbing trainer and mountain guide. Here in the club I 
      serve as a climbing instructor-advisor. We think to have the best climbing
      team of Virginia here at UVa. Let's do it.

I've had a love for the outdoors ever since I got poison ivy all over my chest from a misfortunate accident.  I'm from Chattanooga, Tennessee -- where everyone either climbs or paddles.  I chose paddling and I haven't regretted it yet (much to the chagrin of my climbing colleagues here).  Shoot me an e-mail if you want to hit up some rivers around here.  I also have a love affair with the bicycle and just love being outdoors.  If you want to lead a trip, don't hesitate to let me, or any of the other officers know so we can give you the hook up.
