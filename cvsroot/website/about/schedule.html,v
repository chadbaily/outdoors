<h1>Outdoors at UVa's Upcoming Meetings</h1>

<p>Outdoors at UVa doesn't hold many &ldquo;club meetings,&rdquo; because we're
focused on being in the outdoors (see our <a
href="index.php?page=policies">Mission Statement</a>).  We use our website and
email list to manage the club, and the officers mostly communicate via email.
Meetings are not mandatory and you are not required to attend them in order to
join the club. However, we do hold several large meetings every year.</p>

<p>We are not currently planning any meetings; we held our major interest
meetings in the fall and won't hold any more meetings till next fall.  However,
you can always join the club by clicking the link at left.  We remain active
all year long.</p>

<!-- 

<p>The following table lists our scheduled events:</p>

<table class="top ruled compact cleanHeaders">
  <tr>
    <th>Meeting</th>
    <th>Location</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Date</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td nowrap="1">Activities Fair</td>
    <td>McIntire Amphitheater</td>
    <td>The fall Activities Fair is one of the best chances for people to find
    out about us.  We have a table and staff it with several officers who can
    tell you anything you want to know about the club.
    </td>
    <td nowrap="1">Tue Aug 31, 2004<br>
        10:00 AM - 4:00 PM</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <td nowrap="1">Information Session I</td>
    <td>Minor Hall, Room 125</td>
    <td>This information session is designed to give you an overview of who we
    are, what we do, and why we're the best deal on Grounds.  We'll show
    pictures of past trips and introduce the officers.  Don't miss it &mdash;
    the trip pictures are stunning.  Afterwards we'll hold a sign-up session in
    a nearby library to assist everyone getting signed up and activated, so
    bring cash or a checkbook if you want to join.  This will be the fastest,
    easiest way to become a club member.  You can find this event on the <a
    href="https://etg07.itc.virginia.edu/studentcal/event/display?eventID=10836146550001">UVa
    Student Activities Calendar</a>.
    </td>
    <td nowrap="1">Wed Sep 1, 2004<br>
        7:00 - 8:30 PM</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td nowrap="1">Information Session II</td>
    <td>Minor Hall, Room 125</td>
    <td>This information session is the same as the first one, for those who can't
    make it on Sept. 1st.
    </td>
    <td nowrap="1">Tue Sep 7, 2004<br>
        7:00 - 8:30 PM</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <td nowrap="1">Officer Meetings</td>
    <td>TBD</td>
    <td>The officers will hold several officer meetings this year, but we
    haven't yet decided when.  When we schedule these, we'll post them and
    announce them to the club mailing list so anyone can attend.
    </td>
    <td nowrap="1">TBD</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p><b>If you can't attend the information sessions</b>, don't worry.  They are
just for convenience anyway!  You can <b>always</b> join by clicking the "Join"
link at left.</p>

@need to point out you do not need to attend meetings. Lots of people often ask if they can join since they missed a meeting.
