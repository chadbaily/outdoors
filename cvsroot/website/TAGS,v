@The following files are tagged with special tags in CVS:

.htaccess
Tagged with 'test' tag.  Requires HTTP auth to keep casual users from using the
test or staging sites.

assets/stylesheet.css
Tagged with 'test' tag.  Makes the page have a thick red border to alert you
that you're not on the main site.

members.php
Tagged with 'test' tag.  Implements error handling and reporting instead of
spitting errors back to the browser.

config.php
Tagged with 'test' tag.  Controls which DB tables the system uses.

members.php, index.php
Tagged with 'maintenance' tag.  When updated to this branch, the site just
displays a message about being down for maintenance.

templates/main/main.php
Tagged with 'test' tag, but not used -- the assets/stylesheet.css file, when
stuck to 'test' branch, will create the thick red border.
