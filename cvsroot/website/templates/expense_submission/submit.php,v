@<h1>Submit Expenses</h1>

<table class="tabbedBox" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<div class="box">

<p>Since expenses are not marked as submitted until you explicitly mark them as
submitted, you need to check that this submission contains <b>exactly</b> the
expenses you are actually submitting for reimbursal.  Later, when you receive
the reimbursal, you will use the "Accept" tab to record that the expenses were
accepted and reimbursed.</p>
