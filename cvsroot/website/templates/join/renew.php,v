<p>Please use the following form to choose a new membership.  You will also need
to print a <b>new</b> liability waiver and send it in with your dues (there will
be a link on the next page).</p>

<p class="notice"><b>Note</b> If your membership hasn't been activated and it
has been some time, please <a href="index.php?page=contact">contact the
officers</a> about the problem and we will address it.  If you just need to
print your liability waiver and so forth, <a
