@<h1>Success</h1>

<p>You have successfully renewed your membership.</p>

<p>What now?  Well, here's the procedure.
<ol>
  <li>Print out your <a href="members.php?page=join&action=print-waiver">
  liability waiver</a>. If this doesn't work, installing  
  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"> Adobe Acrobat</a>, 
  or using  a school computer should fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Send it in, with your dues (see the waiver for how much you owe and where
  to send it)</li>
  <li>When we receive all the paperwork and your dues, we will activate your
  new membership and you will get an email message.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, you <b>must</b> print, sign, and send us your liability waiver with
your dues.  Follow the instructions on the waiver itself.  <a
href="members.php?page=join&action=print-waiver">Click here</a> to print
your waiver and instructions.</p>
