@<h1>Check Database Referential Integrity</h1>

<p>This page checks that values in the database correctly refer to a record in
their parent tables.  If you see any results below, that row in the named table
has a value that has no corresponding row in the parent table.  This should be
fixed as soon as possible.</p>

<hr />

{NONE:}
<p class='notice'>There were no results.  None of these values in the
database is orphaned.</p>
{:NONE}

{SOME:}
<p class='notice'>There were {NUMROWS} bad rows in {NUMTABLES} tables.</p>
