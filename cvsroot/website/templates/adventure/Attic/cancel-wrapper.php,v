@<h1>Cancel Adventure</h1>

<p>You are cancelling <b>{C_TITLE}</b>.  Attendees will not be withdrawn from
the adventure (this is for record-keeping purposes).  However, all questions for
this adventure, and the attendees' answers, will be deleted (so the database
doesn't get full of unused data).  The system will email the attendees once you
cancel the adventure.</p>
