@<h1>Create an Adventure</h1>

{ERROR:} 
<p class="error">You cannot remain private and create an adventure.  Please <a
href="members/profile#privacy">edit your profile</a> so
adventure attendees will be able to view your contact information!</p> 
{:ERROR}

{INSTRUCTIONS:}

<p>Follow this process to create an adventure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have you read the <a href="members/resources/leaders-manual">leader's
  manual</a>?  It explains lots of things you need to know.</li>
  <li>Create the adventure with the form below.  The adventure isn't visible at
  this point.</li>
  <li>Add questions to it.</li>
  <li>Join it yourself.</li>
  <li>If you want, you can ask the officers to inspect it before you activate it.</li>
  <li>Activate it (it is now visible to members).</li>
  <li>(Optional) announce it to the mailing list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Be sure to put full details into the adventure's description.  You should
let your attendees know what to bring and what the club will provide, and
anything else they need to be prepared.</p>

<p class="notice">Don't paste text from a word processor.  It'll insert funny
characters that won't come out right.  If you want to draft your description,
use Notepad or another plain-text editor.</p>

<p class="notice">Look for the locations you need in the pulldown menus below.
If you don't see them, click on the link to create a new location, <b>then
refresh this page</b>.</p>

<p>Use this page to create an adventure.  You will first create the adventure,
then associate questions with it (more about this on the next page), then review
it to make sure it's correct, then activate it so all members can see it and
join it.</p>

<p>Be sure to put full details into the adventure's description.  You may
need to let your attendees know</p>

<p class="notice">It is best <b>not</b> to paste from a program such as
Microsoft Word or any other semi-advanced editor.  These editors may insert
funny characters, such as curly quotes and em dashes, that won't display well in
email programs, and then your adventure description will be full of characters
like <tt>&amp;#8211;</tt>.  You should use a plain-text editor such as Notepad
if you want to compose your adventure's text ahead of time.</p>
