<p>Use this page to associate questions with an adventure.  Think of the
questions as a survey that you give to adventure attendees.  You can use this to
find out whether someone is allergic to something, needs certain equipment, is
vegetarian, etc.  When you are organizing your adventure, the website will help
you plan by giving you a report on the answers.</p>

{NOTICE:}
<p class="notice">There is nothing stopping you from editing the questions after
you have activated the adventure, but you may want to notify the members if you
do.  Tell them to log back in, view the adventure, and they should see a link to
edit their answers to the question (if needed).  Deleting questions won't hurt
anything.  Of course, you don't want to change a question's text after someone
has already answered the question either.  That's a media trick :-)</p>
