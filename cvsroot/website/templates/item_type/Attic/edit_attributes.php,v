<p>This table shows the existing attributes for every item of this type.
Deleting an attribute will also delete the attributes from the items themselves.
That is, this page specifies which attributes an item <b>type</b> has, and
therefore which attributes every item of this type is expected to have, too.  If
you remove an attribute from the type, the corresponding attributes will be
deleted from the items, too.</p>
