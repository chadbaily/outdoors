@<h1>Edit Attendee</h1>

<p>You are editing an attendee record.</p>

<p class="notice">In general, this is a very bad idea, because there is a
complicated relationship between the amount an attendee paid, the adventure fee,
refunds, debts, etc etc etc.  The attendee really only <b>records</b> the amount
paid for the trip, and is used for later reference when withdrawing or refunding
or whatever.  <b>You only need to change this if it's inaccurate.</b>  Do not
change it thinking you are adjusting the charges to the member's account,
because you aren't.</p>
