@<h1>Choose a Member and Category</h1>

<p>Please choose a member to whom you wish to check out equipment, and a
category for this checkout:</p>

{form}

<p>The category that you choose will be used to keep track of what gear is often
checked out for various activities.  This enables the website to show
"frequently used" items for various activity types.  If you don't know what this
means, you will see on the next page.  It's just a convenience for you.</p>
