@<h1>Create a Classified Ad</h1>

<p>Use this form to create a new classfied ad.  Try to keep it to the point, and
use key phrases like "WTB" or "For Sale" in the title.</p>

<p class="notice">Notice: these classified ads are for outdoorsy things only,
    such as buying and selling gear.  This is not a dating service or a place to
    find rides home for break.  If your ad doesn't fit into the strictly
    outdoorsy category, please either ask the officers for guidance or check out
    the UVA newsgroups (uva-want-ads is a great one).</p>
