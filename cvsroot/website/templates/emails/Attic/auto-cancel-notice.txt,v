@Dear member,

You previously joined Outdoors at UVa, but did not send in your membership dues,
so we have cancelled your old membership.  We did this because we noticed that
many people came back to our website later and wanted to re-join, but our
records indicated the old membership needed to be paid, and interested folks
like yourselves wanted a fresh start, perhaps with a Spring membership instead
of a full-year membership.  This change should make it possible for you to log
into the website with your username and password from before, choose a
membership option, and make a fresh start at a possibly reduced rate from your
old membership.  Please note that all of your information is still in the
database; we have only cancelled your old choice of membership.

This is an automatically generated message created by a script.  Please let us
know immediately if you think you shouldn't be getting this message.  You can
contact us at outdoors-webmaster@@virginia.edu.
