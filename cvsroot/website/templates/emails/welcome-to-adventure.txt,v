@Dear {C_FULL_NAME},

You've joined '{C_TITLE}'.

Most adventures have a waitlist.  If you can't attend, please use the link below
to withdraw, and let the leader know, even if it's last-minute.  Withdrawing
will automatically let the first person off the waitlist, and will ensure that
you don't get marked as a no-show in the database.

  Leader: {LEADER_NAME} <{LEADER_EMAIL}> {LEADER_PHONE}
 Meet at: {DEPARTURE}, {C_START_DATE|_date_format,'l, M j Y \a\t g:i A'}
     Fee: ${C_FEE}
Withdraw: {BASEURL}/members/adventure/withdraw/{T_ADVENTURE}
 Details: {BASEURL}/members/adventure/read/{T_ADVENTURE}

See you soon!  - {LEADER_NAME}
