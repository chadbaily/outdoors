@centralized the privilege-checking code for tables, just like with objects

Make a nice way for the officers to manage activating memberships

Make the pages/common/include-file.php file know when an action is on a table,
and do a nice abort with a pretty error message if it's not permissible.

De-dupe the join pages.  Peaple shouldn't be allowed have two memberships.

Add a membership-about-to-expire notice to the member home page for the 30 days
prior to the membership expiring.  Link it to the renew page.

Fix the calendar.  The week and day views aren't implemented yet.

Add a "printable" option.

Don't let members post more than one comment on an adventure.  Display the
number of comments and average rating somehow.

Set the script to keep going if the user hits stop.  shutdown or abort or
something...

Remove the abortPage method of Utility.

Make controller calls static.

Rewrite the date-picker.

Add polls.

Allow members to see who went on past trips.

Link to the old site's gallery in a new window.

Expand the magical file-reading scheme for the "about" section to allow
unlimited depth of nesting.

Expand the tabbed-box stuff to allow unlimited depth of nesting.

Finish the constitution.

Fix the data-integrity-checking scripts under the admin section.

Finish the profile section.  Members need to be able to set their privacy
preferences (set the private bit on themselves, their addresses, phone numbers
and chat identities).

Add error messages when a password is wrong, instead of just re-presenting the
password dialog.

Create a non-public member's information tab that only shows up when you are logged in.  "Resources" should be the tab name.
