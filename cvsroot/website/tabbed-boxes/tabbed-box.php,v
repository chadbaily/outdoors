 * This page looks for an object called $cfg['object'] that it can use to check
 * permissions and so forth.  It then generates a row of tabs, one for each
 * action that's permitted on the object except for the 'generic' tabs, and then
 * includes a file that can override these choices, based on the type of object.
 * So if it's an adventure, and the adventure file exists, that file will have a
 * chance to veto the appearance of a tab.
