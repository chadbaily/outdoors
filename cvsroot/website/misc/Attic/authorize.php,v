 * Purpose: requires HTTP authorization.  The variable $cfg['login_mode'] is
 * used to instruct this file whether the current page requires the user to be
 * totally logged in, or if 'partial' mode is acceptable (where the user can
 * access things like the renewal page, etc), or if 'optional' mode is
 * acceptable (the user doesn't have to log in, but if s/he IS logged in
 * already, this file will create the usual Member object).
 *
 * The $cfg['login_mode'] variable has the default value of 'full' and might
 * have been overriden to 'partial' or 'optional' by an including script.
